29.2.1. Unmarked word orders
APV is by far the most frequent word order for transitive clauses, but AVP is
also quite frequent. Both orders seem to have a neutral information structural
value, i.e. none of the arguments is particularly emphasized. Thus, both word
orders are used for the unmarked subject-predicate sentence type in which the
subject (plus any other topical element) is the topic and the predicate is focused
(‘topic-comment sentences’ or ‘predicate-focus structure’). Cross-linguistically,
it is well known that there is a strong correlation between topic and ‘subject’.
That is, in the absence of any contrary indications, the subject of a sentence
will be interpreted as its topic and the predicate as a comment about this topic.
In (1413a, 1413b) the topic (agent) is an unaccented pronoun; it may even be
omitted. The accent falls on the last word of the predicate which is an auxiliary
in both examples.

29.2.2. Patient focus
New referents, especially inanimate referents, are often introduced as patients
into the discourse. In such cases, APV word order is possible (1414a). See for
instance Du Bois (1987), who notes that objects are the preferred grammati-
cal role for introducing new discourse referents. The tendency observed by Du
Bois to introduce new referents as patiens (or single arguments of intransitive
verbs) rather than as agents has been confirmed for Hinuq narratives by Forker
(2007). But since APV is the neutral word order, it is not associated with pa-
tient focus. Thus, for explicit patient focus PVA word order can be employed.
Testelec (1998b) observes that other Daghestanian languages such as Archi also
use PVA to put the patient in focus. In (1414b) the patient karzinkabe ‘baskets’
is introduced as a new referent into the story. The focalized patient in (1414c)
is non-referential and contrasted with the wife, who the man lost. At the same
time the agents in the examples below are topics, and are therefore expressed as
pronouns.
"," Phrases are head-final. In clauses with transitive verbs the most frequent
word order is agent-patient-verb, although main clauses admit all other five logi-
cally possible orders. Only subordinate clauses are more restrictive in their word
order. Generally, word order is strongly influenced by information structure.

",tensor([52.9219])," Since in Hinuq word order is heavily influenced by information structure,
this chapter starts with the analysis of how topic and focus are expressed via word
order (Section 29.2). The three major focus types, i.e. predicate focus (topic-
comment sentences), argument focus (identificational sentences), and sentence
focus (thetic sentences), are treated. This section also includes left and right dis-
location and cleft-like constructions. In Section 29.3 the information structure
of interrogative clauses and in question-answer pairs is described. Section 29.4
briefly examines enclitics and two other constructions that manipulate the in-
formation structure. Some more information on the interplay of word order and
information structure as well as on particles with an certain impact on the infor-
mation structure in Hinuq and other Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found
in Belyaev & Forker (In preparation).
29.2. Word order in declarative main clauses
The most frequent word order in main transitive clauses with two overt argu-
ments is APV, but Hinuq also admits all the other five logical possibilities.
In my corpus word orders can be arranged according to their frequency with
APV>AVP>PVA>VAP/PAV>VPA. There is a strong tendency for the agent to
precede the patient and the verb. The two most frequent word orders APV and
AVP are at the same time the most neutral, unmarked options without any clear
function regarding information structure. Patients in clause-initial position (PVA,
PAV) are often contrastive topics or other extremely salient topics. In intransitive
clauses SV is more frequent than VS. SV is the neutral word order whereas VS
is associated with a certain pragmatic value (Section 29.2.8.2). For more general
information on word order see also Chapter 27.

Postponed modifiers express pragmatic salience. They often have a con-
trastive interpretation, as in (1369a) where the younger brother is contrasted with
his elder brothers. Another possibility for modifiers following their head is to ex-
press new information, i.e. focus. This can be seen as a kind of afterthought of
the speaker, who assumes that the head noun alone does not represent enough
information and adds some information. For instance, in (1369b) the adjective
plus Genitive at the end of the second clause modify q’uč’a ‘oat porridge’, i.e.
the speaker gives some new information about the ingredients of this porridge.
Example (1369c) is similar to (1369b). In (1369d) the postponed double Geni-
tive gives more information about the head ked ‘girl’ by restricting the domain
among which the referent of the head noun has to be chosen.

27.3. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order, clause-level
word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. This order can be found in
pragmatically neutral main clauses, including many elicited simple sentences.
The most frequent templates are S-V, A-P-V and A-R-T-V. Word orders other
than those are also possible. The word order at the clause level in main clauses is
by far more flexible than the word order at the noun phrase level. For word order
in questions see Chapter 28 and Section 29.3.
27.3.1. Main clauses
The overwhelming majority of clauses follow the above given templates. This is
illustrated by (1371a), (1371b), and (1371c) and by numerous other examples in
this grammar.

 Under certain conditions a different word order is preferred. For example, in
reported speech, the matrix verb often precedes the quote which represents its
direct object argument (1372), or it follows the quote and is, in turn, followed by
 Word order at the clause level 739
its S or A argument. More examples of reported speech can be found in Section
22.2.1 and in Chapter 23.

 In principle, all logically possible orders are attested or can be elicited (1373a-
1373f). In a intransitive clauses S-V is more frequent then V-S. In transitive
clauses V-P-A is the least frequent word order, though it is admissible (1373f).
The templates representing the most frequent patterns show that arguments nor-
mally precede the verb, and the A precedes all other arguments and R precedes
T in ditransitive clauses.

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš

 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)
b. [The son is showing a picture to the father. The father asks “Who
 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n
 that I. ERG III-bring.out-RES be=QUOT say-CVB
 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

this chapter starts with the analysis of how topic and focus are expressed via word

Postponed modifiers express pragmatic salience. They often have a con-
trastive interpretation, as in (1369a) where the younger brother is contrasted with
his elder brothers. Another possibility for modifiers following their head is to ex-
press new information, i.e. focus. This can be seen as a kind of afterthought of
the speaker, who assumes that the head noun alone does not represent enough
information and adds some information. For instance, in (1369b) the adjective
plus Genitive at the end of the second clause modify q’uč’a ‘oat porridge’, i.e.
the speaker gives some new information about the ingredients of this porridge.
Example (1369c) is similar to (1369b). In (1369d) the postponed double Geni-
tive gives more information about the head ked ‘girl’ by restricting the domain
among which the referent of the head noun has to be chosen.

pragmatically neutral main clauses, including many elicited simple sentences.

precede the patient and the verb. The two most frequent word orders APV and

function regarding information structure. Patients in clause-initial position (PVA,

clauses SV is more frequent than VS. SV is the neutral word order whereas VS
is associated with a certain pragmatic value (Section 29.2.8.2). For more general

29.2.1. Unmarked word orders
APV is by far the most frequent word order for transitive clauses, but AVP is
also quite frequent. Both orders seem to have a neutral information structural
value, i.e. none of the arguments is particularly emphasized. Thus, both word
orders are used for the unmarked subject-predicate sentence type in which the
subject (plus any other topical element) is the topic and the predicate is focused
(‘topic-comment sentences’ or ‘predicate-focus structure’). Cross-linguistically,
it is well known that there is a strong correlation between topic and ‘subject’.
That is, in the absence of any contrary indications, the subject of a sentence
will be interpreted as its topic and the predicate as a comment about this topic.
In (1413a, 1413b) the topic (agent) is an unaccented pronoun; it may even be
omitted. The accent falls on the last word of the predicate which is an auxiliary
in both examples.

 ‘He is writing a letter.’
 b. [Malla Nasrudin beat the donkey]
 hoboy [haìu-y]TOP gotto zoq’e-n mecxer

 ‘Then it poured money.’ (N)
29.2.2. Patient focus
New referents, especially inanimate referents, are often introduced as patients
into the discourse. In such cases, APV word order is possible (1414a). See for
instance Du Bois (1987), who notes that objects are the preferred grammati-
cal role for introducing new discourse referents. The tendency observed by Du
Bois to introduce new referents as patiens (or single arguments of intransitive
verbs) rather than as agents has been confirmed for Hinuq narratives by Forker
(2007). But since APV is the neutral word order, it is not associated with pa-
tient focus. Thus, for explicit patient focus PVA word order can be employed.
Testelec (1998b) observes that other Daghestanian languages such as Archi also
use PVA to put the patient in focus. In (1414b) the patient karzinkabe ‘baskets’
is introduced as a new referent into the story. The focalized patient in (1414c)
is non-referential and contrasted with the wife, who the man lost. At the same
time the agents in the examples below are topics, and are therefore expressed as
pronouns.

comment sentences), argument focus (identificational sentences), and sentence
focus (thetic sentences), are treated. This section also includes left and right dis-
location and cleft-like constructions. In Section 29.3 the information structure
of interrogative clauses and in question-answer pairs is described. Section 29.4
briefly examines enclitics and two other constructions that manipulate the in-
formation structure. Some more information on the interplay of word order and
information structure as well as on particles with an certain impact on the infor-
mation structure in Hinuq and other Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found
in Belyaev & Forker (In preparation).
29.2. Word order in declarative main clauses
The most frequent word order in main transitive clauses with two overt argu-
ments is APV, but Hinuq also admits all the other five logical possibilities.
In my corpus word orders can be arranged according to their frequency with
APV>AVP>PVA>VAP/PAV>VPA. There is a strong tendency for the agent to
precede the patient and the verb. The two most frequent word orders APV and
AVP are at the same time the most neutral, unmarked options without any clear
function regarding information structure. Patients in clause-initial position (PVA,
PAV) are often contrastive topics or other extremely salient topics. In intransitive
clauses SV is more frequent than VS. SV is the neutral word order whereas VS
is associated with a certain pragmatic value (Section 29.2.8.2). For more general
information on word order see also Chapter 27.
",78.66900634765625,"With respect to word order, one can say that frequently the more prominent
arguments precedes less prominent arguments, but this may be due to topicality
(see Section 27.3 on word order in the clause).

29.2.1. Unmarked word orders
APV is by far the most frequent word order for transitive clauses, but AVP is
also quite frequent. Both orders seem to have a neutral information structural
value, i.e. none of the arguments is particularly emphasized. Thus, both word
orders are used for the unmarked subject-predicate sentence type in which the
subject (plus any other topical element) is the topic and the predicate is focused
(‘topic-comment sentences’ or ‘predicate-focus structure’). Cross-linguistically,
it is well known that there is a strong correlation between topic and ‘subject’.
That is, in the absence of any contrary indications, the subject of a sentence
will be interpreted as its topic and the predicate as a comment about this topic.
In (1413a, 1413b) the topic (agent) is an unaccented pronoun; it may even be
omitted. The accent falls on the last word of the predicate which is an auxiliary
in both examples.

29.2.2. Patient focus
New referents, especially inanimate referents, are often introduced as patients
into the discourse. In such cases, APV word order is possible (1414a). See for
instance Du Bois (1987), who notes that objects are the preferred grammati-
cal role for introducing new discourse referents. The tendency observed by Du
Bois to introduce new referents as patiens (or single arguments of intransitive
verbs) rather than as agents has been confirmed for Hinuq narratives by Forker
(2007). But since APV is the neutral word order, it is not associated with pa-
tient focus. Thus, for explicit patient focus PVA word order can be employed.
Testelec (1998b) observes that other Daghestanian languages such as Archi also
use PVA to put the patient in focus. In (1414b) the patient karzinkabe ‘baskets’
is introduced as a new referent into the story. The focalized patient in (1414c)
is non-referential and contrasted with the wife, who the man lost. At the same
time the agents in the examples below are topics, and are therefore expressed as
pronouns.

WH-questions (=content questions, constituent questions, parametric questions)

tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the
verb (1389c). Again, the word order is predominantly verb-final, but other orders
are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).

If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-

27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.
",75.91714477539062," Since in Hinuq word order is heavily influenced by information structure,
this chapter starts with the analysis of how topic and focus are expressed via word

comment sentences), argument focus (identificational sentences), and sentence

of interrogative clauses and in question-answer pairs is described. Section 29.4

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.

 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship

a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.
",74.52604675292969," Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 737
Postponed modifiers express pragmatic salience. They often have a con-
trastive interpretation, as in (1369a) where the younger brother is contrasted with
his elder brothers. Another possibility for modifiers following their head is to ex-
press new information, i.e. focus. This can be seen as a kind of afterthought of
the speaker, who assumes that the head noun alone does not represent enough
information and adds some information. For instance, in (1369b) the adjective
plus Genitive at the end of the second clause modify q’uč’a ‘oat porridge’, i.e.
the speaker gives some new information about the ingredients of this porridge.
Example (1369c) is similar to (1369b). In (1369d) the postponed double Geni-
tive gives more information about the head ked ‘girl’ by restricting the domain
among which the referent of the head noun has to be chosen.

There is a very strong tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adja-

27.3. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order, clause-level
word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. This order can be found in
pragmatically neutral main clauses, including many elicited simple sentences.
The most frequent templates are S-V, A-P-V and A-R-T-V. Word orders other
than those are also possible. The word order at the clause level in main clauses is
by far more flexible than the word order at the noun phrase level. For word order
in questions see Chapter 28 and Section 29.3.
27.3.1. Main clauses
The overwhelming majority of clauses follow the above given templates. This is
illustrated by (1371a), (1371b), and (1371c) and by numerous other examples in
this grammar.
(1371) a. S-V
 nesa:-smixb-aq’e-n

 ‘The evening time came.’ (N)
b. A-P-V

 ‘The girl broke the sugar.’ (N)

 now that.OBL father-ERG they.OBL - DAT separately house=and
 toň-no
 give-UWPST
 ‘The father gave them a separate house.’ (N)
 Under certain conditions a different word order is preferred. For example, in
reported speech, the matrix verb often precedes the quote which represents its
direct object argument (1372), or it follows the quote and is, in turn, followed by
 Word order at the clause level 739
its S or A argument. More examples of reported speech can be found in Section
22.2.1 and in Chapter 23.

 this.OBL horse-ERG say-PRS I be-PST you.SG . DAT predestinated
 gulu”
 horse
 ‘The horse says “I was your predestinated horse.”’ (N)
 In principle, all logically possible orders are attested or can be elicited (1373a-
1373f). In a intransitive clauses S-V is more frequent then V-S. In transitive
clauses V-P-A is the least frequent word order, though it is admissible (1373f).
The templates representing the most frequent patterns show that arguments nor-
mally precede the verb, and the A precedes all other arguments and R precedes
T in ditransitive clauses.
(1373)a. A-P-V
ked-imagalu b-u:-s
girl-ERG bread( III) III-do-PST
‘The girl made bread.’
b.",77.3351821899414,"V-P-A

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).
(1374)a. hezzodoy hadbe b-iň’i-yozoq’e-n

 d. hado adaru=tow xexìi-ň’o k’oňe-n
 he naked=EMPH speed-SPR jump-UWPST
 ‘He, being naked, jumped fast.’ (N)
In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n
 you.SG content be=Q stone.OBL - OBL . PL - AT=and I-tie-CVB
raìad-li-ì-er kur-ayaz?

‘Do you agree to be thrown into the sea tied to stones?’ (N)
 b. bič’ib-iq-edebez?

‘Do you understand (it)?’ (N)
 c. [meži di-qo es-a] behezi.r.iqqo gom=e?
you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

29.2.1. Unmarked word orders
APV is by far the most frequent word order for transitive clauses, but AVP is
also quite frequent. Both orders seem to have a neutral information structural
value, i.e. none of the arguments is particularly emphasized. Thus, both word
orders are used for the unmarked subject-predicate sentence type in which the
subject (plus any other topical element) is the topic and the predicate is focused
(‘topic-comment sentences’ or ‘predicate-focus structure’). Cross-linguistically,
it is well known that there is a strong correlation between topic and ‘subject’.
That is, in the absence of any contrary indications, the subject of a sentence
will be interpreted as its topic and the predicate as a comment about this topic.
In (1413a, 1413b) the topic (agent) is an unaccented pronoun; it may even be
omitted. The accent falls on the last word of the predicate which is an auxiliary
in both examples.

29.2.2. Patient focus
New referents, especially inanimate referents, are often introduced as patients
into the discourse. In such cases, APV word order is possible (1414a). See for
instance Du Bois (1987), who notes that objects are the preferred grammati-
cal role for introducing new discourse referents. The tendency observed by Du
Bois to introduce new referents as patiens (or single arguments of intransitive
verbs) rather than as agents has been confirmed for Hinuq narratives by Forker
(2007). But since APV is the neutral word order, it is not associated with pa-
tient focus. Thus, for explicit patient focus PVA word order can be employed.
Testelec (1998b) observes that other Daghestanian languages such as Archi also
use PVA to put the patient in focus. In (1414b) the patient karzinkabe ‘baskets’
is introduced as a new referent into the story. The focalized patient in (1414c)
is non-referential and contrasted with the wife, who the man lost. At the same
time the agents in the examples below are topics, and are therefore expressed as
pronouns.

Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e
 oldthis man / this oldman
 ‘this old man’
 c. č’ek’k’u=tow ìono=n haìo-s[ked-zo] obu-s
 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš
 you.SG he.ERG I-betray-PST
 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)
b. [The son is showing a picture to the father. The father asks “Who
 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n
 that I. ERG III-bring.out-RES be=QUOT say-CVB
 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš
 you.SG he.ERG I-betray-PST
 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)
b. [The son is showing a picture to the father. The father asks “Who
 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n
 that I. ERG III-bring.out-RES be=QUOT say-CVB
 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

is used to mark non-canonical agents in causative constructions; this explanation
makes use of the hierarchy of syntactic positions: Comrie (1976b) notes that
in the paradigm case of causatives derived from transitive verbs, the causee is
likely to take the same case marking as indirect objects in ditransitive clauses.
Embedded subjects (e.g. causees) are demoted stepwise down the case hierarchy
(subject, direct object, indirect object, other obliques). Transitive verbs already
have a subject and a direct object, thus the newly added argument takes the role of
the indirect object. In Hinuq, indirect objects of ditransitive verbs like ‘give’ are
marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.
","Word order in declarative main clauses 757
29.2.1. Unmarked word orders
APV is by far the most frequent word order for transitive clauses, but AVP is
also quite frequent. Both orders seem to have a neutral information structural
value, i.e. none of the arguments is particularly emphasized. Thus, both word
orders are used for the unmarked subject-predicate sentence type in which the
subject (plus any other topical element) is the topic and the predicate is focused
(‘topic-comment sentences’ or ‘predicate-focus structure’). Cross-linguistically,
it is well known that there is a strong correlation between topic and ‘subject’.
That is, in the absence of any contrary indications, the subject of a sentence
will be interpreted as its topic and the predicate as a comment about this topic.
In (1413a, 1413b) the topic (agent) is an unaccented pronoun; it may even be
omitted. The accent falls on the last word of the predicate which is an auxiliary
in both examples.
(1413) a. [What is your brother doing right now?]
 [hayìoy]TOP kaGat caxxogoì
 he.ERG letter write.ICVB be
 ‘He is writing a letter.’
 b. [Malla Nasrudin beat the donkey]
 hoboy [haìu-y]TOP gotto zoq’e-n mecxer
 then this.obl-erg pour.icvb be-uwpst money
 ‘Then it poured money.’ (N)
29.2.2. Patient focus
New referents, especially inanimate referents, are often introduced as patients
into the discourse. In such cases, APV word order is possible (1414a). See for
instance Du Bois (1987), who notes that objects are the preferred grammati-
cal role for introducing new discourse referents. The tendency observed by Du
Bois to introduce new referents as patiens (or single arguments of intransitive
verbs) rather than as agents has been confirmed for Hinuq narratives by Forker
(2007). But since APV is the neutral word order, it is not associated with pa-
tient focus. Thus, for explicit patient focus PVA word order can be employed.
Testelec (1998b) observes that other Daghestanian languages such as Archi also
use PVA to put the patient in focus. In (1414b) the patient karzinkabe ‘baskets’
is introduced as a new referent into the story. The focalized patient in (1414c)
is non-referential and contrasted with the wife, who the man lost. At the same
time the agents in the examples below are topics, and are therefore expressed as
pronouns.

Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e
 oldthis man / this oldman
 ‘this old man’
 c. č’ek’k’u=tow ìono=n haìo-s[ked-zo] obu-s
 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n

you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).

‘the friend of Murad, who came home’ (i.e. The fried came home.)
If, however, the Genitive precedes the head noun, then it cannot function as
the nucleus of the relative clause. Therefore, it is either interpreted as belonging
to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.

27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.

At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely

27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).

 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.

 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted

Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified

27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu

 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).

 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s

 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu

d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek

 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe

 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi

b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).

Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).

 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš
 you.SG he.ERG I-betray-PST
 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)
b. [The son is showing a picture to the father. The father asks “Who
 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n
 that I. ERG III-bring.out-RES be=QUOT say-CVB
 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.

If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).

to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.

27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).

732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš

 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)

 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n

 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

 In addition to bišun and ič’č’a, Hinuq has a few adverbs that express degree.
They are all Avar loan words (301). For more details on degree adverbs see
Section 10.4.4.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.

 ‘the house of my brother, who went to town’
If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).
(1367)a. [haìo-deň’oq’ar goìa] sedanartaw-es hači

c. [idu-r Ø-aq’-o goìa] Murad-eshudul
home-LAT I-come-ICVB be.PTCP Murad-GEN 1 friend
‘the friend of Murad, who came home’ (i.e. The fried came home.)
If, however, the Genitive precedes the head noun, then it cannot function as
the nucleus of the relative clause. Therefore, it is either interpreted as belonging
to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.
(1368)a. [Maèama-s aže y-occo goìa] uži
Mahama-GEN 1 tree(IV ) IV-cut.ICVB be.PTCP son
‘the son who cut Mahama’s tree’ (not: Mahama’s son who cut the

b. Murad-es[idu-r Ø-aq’-ogoìa] hudul
Murad-GEN 1 home-LAT I-come-ICVB be.PTCP friend
‘Murad’s friend, who came home’ (i.e. the friend came home)
27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.
"," If the question focuses on the S or A argument, then the focal argument in
the answer occupies the first position (1439a) and/or may directly precede the
verb. In the last case the word order (in transitive clauses) is either AVP (1439b)
or PAV (1439c) when explicitly topicalizing the patient (see also (1417b)).
",73.27600860595703,"With respect to word order, one can say that frequently the more prominent
arguments precedes less prominent arguments, but this may be due to topicality
(see Section 27.3 on word order in the clause).

21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.
(1075) a. eli [me elu-ì-edokezi.y.iq-o-me]
we.ERG you.SG we.OBL - CONT- DIR meet.II-COND - NEG
ň’u=nb-iG-agoì ň’ere-s

‘If you are not on our side, we will take away the roof from above.’
(N)
b. “Üumar”=ňen eňi-yo, “žiqu=šid me t’ot’er-o, me
Umar=QUOT say-PRS today=on you.SG . ERG read-IMP you.SG

learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.
(1076) a. me [hago Ø-ot’-nos] [hayìo-s b-ašir-no
you.SG . ERG heI -lay- ANT he. OBL - GEN 1 III-catch- CVB
q’oňu] [č’e-da-dokur-no]b-ek’ w er-o!=ňen

‘After he goes to bed you take his skin, throw it into the fire, and
burn it!’ (N)

home-DIR I-come-ANT brother(I) rain(V) V-come-CONC wood(V)
èadur r-u:-s
prepare V-do-PST
‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it
rained.’
Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.
(1077) a. * mecxeruži: k’oèlo b-ux-iš[b-aši-nos]
money( III) boy.ERG ball(III) III-buy-PST III-get-ANT
 (After the boy got the money, he bought a ball.)
b. * uži: [b-aši-yň’o] sayGat b-ux-išmecxer
 boy.ERG III-get-SIM present(III) III-buy-PST money(III)
 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).
(1078) [idu-rØ-aq’e-yň’o yoňu.koka] boìiň’o b-iň’i-yogoìa
 home-LAT I-come-SIM cinderello hunting HPL-go-ICVB be.PTCP

 brother.PL meat(V)=and V-ring-CVB HPL-come-UWPST
 ‘When Cinderello came home, his brothers who were gone hunting came
 home bringing meat.’ (N)
Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.

attributes is given in Section 27.2.

with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.

 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)
 ‘A small child is coming to him.’ (S)
 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez
I.OBL - GEN 2 father-ERG what three ORD question you.SG . DAT
neň-i?

‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”
who-DAT III-want-PRS = QUOT say-CVB monkey(III)
‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.
(1438)a. se r-uw-anhaìouži-ž, Ø-uher-an=ehado?

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.

29.2.5. Clause-initial position of the verbal complex
In practice, the word order in verb-initial clauses is always VAP. Of sentences
with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my
corpus.145 Testelec (1998b) claims that in Daghestanian languages verb-initial
clauses are contrastive and occur if the action denoted by the relevant verb is
contrasted with some other action. In fact, there seem to be a few such cases in
my corpus where predicates are contrastive and thus occur clause-initially, e.g. in
(1421a) two actions (reading and knowing) are contrasted with each other. Both

21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.
(1075) a. eli [me elu-ì-edokezi.y.iq-o-me]
we.ERG you.SG we.OBL - CONT- DIR meet.II-COND - NEG
ň’u=nb-iG-agoì ň’ere-s
earth.roof(III)=and III-take-INF be upwards-ABL 1
‘If you are not on our side, we will take away the roof from above.’
(N)
b. “Üumar”=ňen eňi-yo, “žiqu=šid me t’ot’er-o, me
Umar=QUOT say-PRS today=on you.SG . ERG read-IMP you.SG
t’ot’er-o [debez r-et-ače]!”
learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.
(1076) a. me [hago Ø-ot’-nos] [hayìo-s b-ašir-no
you.SG . ERG heI -lay- ANT he. OBL - GEN 1 III-catch- CVB
q’oňu] [č’e-da-dokur-no]b-ek’ w er-o!=ňen

‘After he goes to bed you take his skin, throw it into the fire, and
burn it!’ (N)

home-DIR I-come-ANT brother(I) rain(V) V-come-CONC wood(V)
èadur r-u:-s
prepare V-do-PST
‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it
rained.’
Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.
(1077) a. * mecxeruži: k’oèlo b-ux-iš[b-aši-nos]
money( III) boy.ERG ball(III) III-buy-PST III-get-ANT
 (After the boy got the money, he bought a ball.)
b. * uži: [b-aši-yň’o] sayGat b-ux-išmecxer
 boy.ERG III-get-SIM present(III) III-buy-PST money(III)
 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).
(1078) [idu-rØ-aq’e-yň’o yoňu.koka] boìiň’o b-iň’i-yogoìa

 brother.PL meat(V)=and V-ring-CVB HPL-come-UWPST
 ‘When Cinderello came home, his brothers who were gone hunting came
 home bringing meat.’ (N)
Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.
(1079) a. [čorpa ga:-nos] hago untezi Ø-iq-iš

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.

Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e
 oldthis man / this oldman
 ‘this old man’
 c. č’ek’k’u=tow ìono=n haìo-s[ked-zo] obu-s
 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).
(1374)a. hezzodoy hadbe b-iň’i-yozoq’e-n

 d. hado adaru=tow xexìi-ň’o k’oňe-n
 he naked=EMPH speed-SPR jump-UWPST

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Chapter 28
Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n

you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì
house(III) III-big be
‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’
b. hadu ked c’aq’=tow bercinaw zeq’ w e-n

c. Üumru=n b-egiy zoq’e-s elu-shayteì
 life(III)=and III-good be-PST we.OBL - GEN 1 there
 ‘And our life there was good.’ (N)
Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).

 ‘Well, these bags are filled with money.’ (N)
18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.

Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).

tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).

When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).

c. had kaGat Pat’imat-ň’o-r goì

18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).
(964) a. boň’uq piq=nor-iči-yozoq’e-s

 ‘There were all possible kinds of fruits.’ (N)
 b. hes zoq’e-n miskin rek’ w e

 ‘There was one poor man.’ (N)
18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì
 in.one.place house.IN mouse be
 ‘In one place, in a house there is a mouse.’ or ‘A mouse is on one
 place, in a house.’ (N)

 b. ardel elu-deaši šayt’an-be zoq’e-s=ňen

c. Čačan-ň’ozoq’ w e-s sadaq aldiyu buňe-be
 Chechnya-SPR be-PST all white house-PL
 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.

29.2.5. Clause-initial position of the verbal complex
In practice, the word order in verb-initial clauses is always VAP. Of sentences
with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my
corpus.145 Testelec (1998b) claims that in Daghestanian languages verb-initial
clauses are contrastive and occur if the action denoted by the relevant verb is
contrasted with some other action. In fact, there seem to be a few such cases in
my corpus where predicates are contrastive and thus occur clause-initially, e.g. in
(1421a) two actions (reading and knowing) are contrasted with each other. Both
145 There may well be one or two such examples, but the only VAP-like sentence that I
came across seems to be rather a right detachment construction.

 ‘the house of my brother, who went to town’
If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).

c. [idu-r Ø-aq’-o goìa] Murad-eshudul
home-LAT I-come-ICVB be.PTCP Murad-GEN 1 friend
‘the friend of Murad, who came home’ (i.e. The fried came home.)
If, however, the Genitive precedes the head noun, then it cannot function as
the nucleus of the relative clause. Therefore, it is either interpreted as belonging
to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.

27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n

you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.

learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.

‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it

Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.

 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).

Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.
",72.4890365600586," Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 737
Postponed modifiers express pragmatic salience. They often have a con-
trastive interpretation, as in (1369a) where the younger brother is contrasted with
his elder brothers. Another possibility for modifiers following their head is to ex-
press new information, i.e. focus. This can be seen as a kind of afterthought of
the speaker, who assumes that the head noun alone does not represent enough
information and adds some information. For instance, in (1369b) the adjective
plus Genitive at the end of the second clause modify q’uč’a ‘oat porridge’, i.e.
the speaker gives some new information about the ingredients of this porridge.
Example (1369c) is similar to (1369b). In (1369d) the postponed double Geni-
tive gives more information about the head ked ‘girl’ by restricting the domain
among which the referent of the head noun has to be chosen.

There is a very strong tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adja-
cent, but occasionally there are examples of discontinuous noun phrases. Thus,
in (1370a) the adjective bercinaw ‘beautiful’ is separated from its head rek’ w e.

 ‘Which command did the khan make?’ (N)
27.3. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order, clause-level
word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. This order can be found in
pragmatically neutral main clauses, including many elicited simple sentences.
The most frequent templates are S-V, A-P-V and A-R-T-V. Word orders other
than those are also possible. The word order at the clause level in main clauses is
by far more flexible than the word order at the noun phrase level. For word order
in questions see Chapter 28 and Section 29.3.
27.3.1. Main clauses
The overwhelming majority of clauses follow the above given templates. This is
illustrated by (1371a), (1371b), and (1371c) and by numerous other examples in
this grammar.
(1371) a. S-V
 nesa:-smixb-aq’e-n
 in.the.evening-GEN 1 hour(III) III-come-UWPST
 ‘The evening time came.’ (N)
b. A-P-V

 ‘The girl broke the sugar.’ (N)
c. A-R-T-V

 now that.OBL father-ERG they.OBL - DAT separately house=and
 toň-no
 give-UWPST
 ‘The father gave them a separate house.’ (N)
 Under certain conditions a different word order is preferred. For example, in
reported speech, the matrix verb often precedes the quote which represents its
direct object argument (1372), or it follows the quote and is, in turn, followed by
 Word order at the clause level 739
its S or A argument. More examples of reported speech can be found in Section
22.2.1 and in Chapter 23.
(1372) haìugulu-y eňi-yo “de zeq’ w e-s debez nasibaw
 this.OBL horse-ERG say-PRS I be-PST you.SG . DAT predestinated
 gulu”
 horse
 ‘The horse says “I was your predestinated horse.”’ (N)
 In principle, all logically possible orders are attested or can be elicited (1373a-
1373f). In a intransitive clauses S-V is more frequent then V-S. In transitive
clauses V-P-A is the least frequent word order, though it is admissible (1373f).
The templates representing the most frequent patterns show that arguments nor-
mally precede the verb, and the A precedes all other arguments and R precedes
T in ditransitive clauses.
(1373)a. A-P-V
ked-imagalu b-u:-s

b.",tensor([39.7248]),"736 Chapter 27. Word order

 town.IN - DIR I-go-ICVB be.PTCP I. GEN 2 brother(I)-GEN 1 house
 ‘the house of my brother, who went to town’
If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).
(1367)a. [haìo-deň’oq’ar goìa] sedanartaw-es hači

‘the sneezing of one giant in front of him’ (N)

c. [idu-r Ø-aq’-o goìa] Murad-eshudul
home-LAT I-come-ICVB be.PTCP Murad-GEN 1 friend
‘the friend of Murad, who came home’ (i.e. The fried came home.)
If, however, the Genitive precedes the head noun, then it cannot function as
the nucleus of the relative clause. Therefore, it is either interpreted as belonging
to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.
(1368)a. [Maèama-s aže y-occo goìa] uži

‘Murad’s friend, who came home’ (i.e. the friend came home)
27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.

29.2.3. Topicalizing the patient
Since there is already a strong correlation between ‘subject’ (i.e. A or S) and
topic, there is usually no correlation between objects/patients (P) and topics. In
other words, special constructions are needed to topicalize the patient. In order
to code patients as topics, Hinuq often uses otherwise infrequent word orders
and detachment constructions. PAV word order produces sentences like Mary, I
never saw. In Hinuq, this word order is mainly used for highly topical referents
such as first and second person pronouns (1417a) or otherwise topical referents
as in (1417b) where the speaker shows a picture (= the topic) to the hearer. In
contrast to other Daghestanian languages analyzed by Testelec (1998b), Hinuq
does not seem to make special use of PAV word order to put the agent in focus.
(1417) a. [me]TOP hayìoy Ø-aň’ir-iš
 you.SG he.ERG I-betray-PST
 ‘He betrayed you (masc.).’ (N)
b. [The son is showing a picture to the father. The father asks “Who
 made that?”]
 “[haw]TOP deb-iG-iš goì”=ňen eňi-n
 that I. ERG III-bring.out-RES be=QUOT say-CVB
 ‘As for that, I made it.’ (N)
 Besides PAV constructions Givón distinguishes another type of detachment
construction with a clause-initial patient, namely left dislocation (Mary, I never
saw her there). The function of left dislocation is to code a not-yet-active topic
referent in the form of a referring expression placed in a syntactically autonomous
position to the left of the clause. In my Hinuq corpus, there are a few examples of
left dislocation. The pronoun can have various functions in its clause: stimulus
(1418b), A (1418a), P, oblique, adjunct, or it can even be a complement clause.

clause becoming involved in an activity): Infinitive/Purposive converb,

time): case-marked Past participle or Masdar
 – fact type (refers to the fact that something took place): zero making, Resul-
tative or Habitual participle plus Abstract suffix, Quotative enclitic, Nar-
rative converb
 As in all clause types of Hinuq, the word order in complement clauses is
predominantly but not strictly head-final. Examples with head-final word order
can be found throughout this chapter. (1080) illustrates a complement clause
where the verb in the complement clause does not appear in the last position.

 In Tables 81–83 the most important complement-taking verbs and construc-
tions and their strategies are subsumed. The column ‘case’ gives the case mark-
ing of the most prominent argument of these verbs. The abbreviations used are

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 ‘In that village there is a khan, and he is ill.’ (N)
 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)

 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez

‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”
who-DAT III-want-PRS = QUOT say-CVB monkey(III)
‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.
",tensor([40.4989])," If the question focuses on the S or A argument, then the focal argument in
the answer occupies the first position (1439a) and/or may directly precede the
verb. In the last case the word order (in transitive clauses) is either AVP (1439b)
or PAV (1439c) when explicitly topicalizing the patient (see also (1417b)).

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n
 you.SG content be=Q stone.OBL - OBL . PL - AT=and I-tie-CVB

 c. [meži di-qo es-a] behezi.r.iqqo gom=e?
you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.
",72.2984619140625," * Maèama-y Murad oPocu b-uher-er-hogoì
Mahama-ERG Murat chicken(III) III-kill-CAUS - ICVB be
(Mahama makes Murat kill the chicken.)
The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).
(948)a. hayìoy močigoì b-eň-o
he.ERG field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
‘It is the field that he is ploughing.’
 b. * hago močigoì b-eň-o
he field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
(It is the field that he is ploughing.)
 Biabsolutive constructions 525
Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).
(949)a. * obu močižiqu b-eň-ogoì
 father field(III) today III-plough-ICVB be
 (The father ploughs the field today.)
 b.hago magalu ked-ez toňňo goì
 he bread girl-DAT give.ICVB be
 ‘He gives the girl bread.’
Similarly, the patient cannot undergo left (950a) or right dislocation (950b).
This is only possible in the Ergative construction.
(950)a. * c’inda-be iyo r-u:-ho goì
 socks-PL mother NHPL-do-ICVB be
 (It is knitted socks that the mother makes.)
 b. * iyo r-u:-ho goì c’inda-be
 mother NHPL-do-ICVB be socks-PL
 (Mother makes knitted socks.)
Consequently, in the biabsolutive construction, the patient and the lexical
verb form a tight unit which can hardly ever be interrupted. So the word order
is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

",70.8513412475586,"Chapter 27
Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e

 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be

 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

If the Genitive follows the head noun, the relative clause is usually inter-
preted as modifying the Genitive and not the head of the Genitive (1367a). In
principle, another interpretation where both the relative clause and the Genitive
modify the head noun is possible if it is semantically plausible (1367b, 1367c).

‘the friend of Murad, who came home’ (i.e. The fried came home.)
If, however, the Genitive precedes the head noun, then it cannot function as
the nucleus of the relative clause. Therefore, it is either interpreted as belonging
to the relative clause (1368a) or as modifying the head together with the rela-
tive clause (1368b) depending on the semantics and pragmatics of the phrase in
question.

27.2.4. Uncommon word orders
Word order is relatively free in Hinuq. But different word orders are often associ-
ated with different pragmatic values. A more detailed account of the relationship
between word order and information structure is given in Section 29.2. Here only
a few examples at the noun phrase level are discussed.
",tensor([37.7269])," Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 737
Postponed modifiers express pragmatic salience. They often have a con-
trastive interpretation, as in (1369a) where the younger brother is contrasted with
his elder brothers. Another possibility for modifiers following their head is to ex-
press new information, i.e. focus. This can be seen as a kind of afterthought of
the speaker, who assumes that the head noun alone does not represent enough
information and adds some information. For instance, in (1369b) the adjective
plus Genitive at the end of the second clause modify q’uč’a ‘oat porridge’, i.e.
the speaker gives some new information about the ingredients of this porridge.
Example (1369c) is similar to (1369b). In (1369d) the postponed double Geni-
tive gives more information about the head ked ‘girl’ by restricting the domain
among which the referent of the head noun has to be chosen.

There is a very strong tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adja-
cent, but occasionally there are examples of discontinuous noun phrases. Thus,
in (1370a) the adjective bercinaw ‘beautiful’ is separated from its head rek’ w e.

27.3. Word order at the clause level
Like noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order, clause-level
word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. This order can be found in
pragmatically neutral main clauses, including many elicited simple sentences.
The most frequent templates are S-V, A-P-V and A-R-T-V. Word orders other
than those are also possible. The word order at the clause level in main clauses is
by far more flexible than the word order at the noun phrase level. For word order
in questions see Chapter 28 and Section 29.3.
27.3.1. Main clauses
The overwhelming majority of clauses follow the above given templates. This is
illustrated by (1371a), (1371b), and (1371c) and by numerous other examples in
this grammar.

 Under certain conditions a different word order is preferred. For example, in
reported speech, the matrix verb often precedes the quote which represents its
direct object argument (1372), or it follows the quote and is, in turn, followed by
 Word order at the clause level 739
its S or A argument. More examples of reported speech can be found in Section
22.2.1 and in Chapter 23.

 In principle, all logically possible orders are attested or can be elicited (1373a-
1373f). In a intransitive clauses S-V is more frequent then V-S. In transitive
clauses V-P-A is the least frequent word order, though it is admissible (1373f).
The templates representing the most frequent patterns show that arguments nor-
mally precede the verb, and the A precedes all other arguments and R precedes
T in ditransitive clauses.

",72.2401351928711," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )
 ‘a big Avar carpet’
 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.
(303) a. bišun b-Ü eži buňe/ ič’č’a b-Ü eži buňe

Chapter 7
Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.
","Shamil song=and call-CVB = Q I-go-PRS home-DIR
‘Is Shamil going home SINGING A SONG?’
21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.
(1075) a. eli [me elu-ì-edokezi.y.iq-o-me]
we.ERG you.SG we.OBL - CONT- DIR meet.II-COND - NEG
ň’u=nb-iG-agoì ň’ere-s
earth.roof(III)=and III-take-INF be upwards-ABL 1
‘If you are not on our side, we will take away the roof from above.’
(N)
b. “Üumar”=ňen eňi-yo, “žiqu=šid me t’ot’er-o, me
Umar=QUOT say-PRS today=on you.SG . ERG read-IMP you.SG
t’ot’er-o [debez r-et-ače]!”
learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.
(1076) a. me [hago Ø-ot’-nos] [hayìo-s b-ašir-no
you.SG . ERG heI -lay- ANT he. OBL - GEN 1 III-catch- CVB
q’oňu] [č’e-da-dokur-no]b-ek’ w er-o!=ňen
skin(III ) fire-OBL . IN - DIR throw-CVB III-burn-IMP = QUOT
‘After he goes to bed you take his skin, throw it into the fire, and
burn it!’ (N)
b. [idu-do Ø-aq’e-nos] essu-y[qema r-aq’-ono], qaca
home-DIR I-come-ANT brother(I) rain(V) V-come-CONC wood(V)
èadur r-u:-s
prepare V-do-PST
‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it
rained.’
Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.
(1077) a. * mecxeruži: k’oèlo b-ux-iš[b-aši-nos]
money( III) boy.ERG ball(III) III-buy-PST III-get-ANT
 (After the boy got the money, he bought a ball.)
b. * uži: [b-aši-yň’o] sayGat b-ux-išmecxer
 boy.ERG III-get-SIM present(III) III-buy-PST money(III)
 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).
(1078) [idu-rØ-aq’e-yň’o yoňu.koka] boìiň’o b-iň’i-yogoìa
 home-LAT I-come-SIM cinderello hunting HPL-go-ICVB be.PTCP
 essnixu=n r-aq’er-no b-aq’e-n
 brother.PL meat(V)=and V-ring-CVB HPL-come-UWPST
 ‘When Cinderello came home, his brothers who were gone hunting came
 home bringing meat.’ (N)
Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.
(1079) a. [čorpa ga:-nos] hago untezi Ø-iq-iš

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.

29.2.5. Clause-initial position of the verbal complex
In practice, the word order in verb-initial clauses is always VAP. Of sentences
with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my
corpus.145 Testelec (1998b) claims that in Daghestanian languages verb-initial
clauses are contrastive and occur if the action denoted by the relevant verb is
contrasted with some other action. In fact, there seem to be a few such cases in
my corpus where predicates are contrastive and thus occur clause-initially, e.g. in
(1421a) two actions (reading and knowing) are contrasted with each other. Both
145 There may well be one or two such examples, but the only VAP-like sentence that I
came across seems to be rather a right detachment construction.

Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e
 oldthis man / this oldman
 ‘this old man’
 c. č’ek’k’u=tow ìono=n haìo-s[ked-zo] obu-s
 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)

 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez

‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)

‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.
",71.71102905273438,"Shamil song=and call-CVB = Q I-go-PRS home-DIR
‘Is Shamil going home SINGING A SONG?’
21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.
(1075) a. eli [me elu-ì-edokezi.y.iq-o-me]
we.ERG you.SG we.OBL - CONT- DIR meet.II-COND - NEG
ň’u=nb-iG-agoì ň’ere-s

(N)
b. “Üumar”=ňen eňi-yo, “žiqu=šid me t’ot’er-o, me
Umar=QUOT say-PRS today=on you.SG . ERG read-IMP you.SG

learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.
(1076) a. me [hago Ø-ot’-nos] [hayìo-s b-ašir-no

home-DIR I-come-ANT brother(I) rain(V) V-come-CONC wood(V)
èadur r-u:-s
prepare V-do-PST
‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it
rained.’
Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.
(1077) a. * mecxeruži: k’oèlo b-ux-iš[b-aši-nos]
money( III) boy.ERG ball(III) III-buy-PST III-get-ANT
 (After the boy got the money, he bought a ball.)
b. * uži: [b-aši-yň’o] sayGat b-ux-išmecxer
 boy.ERG III-get-SIM present(III) III-buy-PST money(III)
 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).
(1078) [idu-rØ-aq’e-yň’o yoňu.koka] boìiň’o b-iň’i-yogoìa

 brother.PL meat(V)=and V-ring-CVB HPL-come-UWPST
 ‘When Cinderello came home, his brothers who were gone hunting came
 home bringing meat.’ (N)
Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.
",80.78158569335938
0.7867248835706873,1,1,0.7756401611120483,1,0.7979798486053543,3,0.7500017946244907,4,0.8308305437506072,1,0.81515572546132,2,0.7899511740175114,2,0.8217691319912244,2,0.764459466291485," * Maèama-y Murad oPocu b-uher-er-hogoì
Mahama-ERG Murat chicken(III) III-kill-CAUS - ICVB be
(Mahama makes Murat kill the chicken.)
The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).
(948)a. hayìoy močigoì b-eň-o
he.ERG field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
‘It is the field that he is ploughing.’
 b. * hago močigoì b-eň-o
he field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
(It is the field that he is ploughing.)
 Biabsolutive constructions 525
Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).
(949)a. * obu močižiqu b-eň-ogoì
 father field(III) today III-plough-ICVB be
 (The father ploughs the field today.)
 b.hago magalu ked-ez toňňo goì
 he bread girl-DAT give.ICVB be
 ‘He gives the girl bread.’
Similarly, the patient cannot undergo left (950a) or right dislocation (950b).
This is only possible in the Ergative construction.
(950)a. * c’inda-be iyo r-u:-ho goì
 socks-PL mother NHPL-do-ICVB be
 (It is knitted socks that the mother makes.)
 b. * iyo r-u:-ho goì c’inda-be
 mother NHPL-do-ICVB be socks-PL
 (Mother makes knitted socks.)
Consequently, in the biabsolutive construction, the patient and the lexical
verb form a tight unit which can hardly ever be interrupted. So the word order
is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).

 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

29.2.5. Clause-initial position of the verbal complex
In practice, the word order in verb-initial clauses is always VAP. Of sentences
with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my
corpus.145 Testelec (1998b) claims that in Daghestanian languages verb-initial
clauses are contrastive and occur if the action denoted by the relevant verb is
contrasted with some other action. In fact, there seem to be a few such cases in
my corpus where predicates are contrastive and thus occur clause-initially, e.g. in
(1421a) two actions (reading and knowing) are contrasted with each other. Both
145 There may well be one or two such examples, but the only VAP-like sentence that I
came across seems to be rather a right detachment construction.

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).
(1300) a. diessu dew-zo essu-de-r bercinaw goì
I.GEN 1 sister you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 sister-ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
 Comparative constructions 709
 b. dew-zoessu-de-r diessu bercinaw goì
 you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 I.GEN 1 sister sister- ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).
(1301)a. di obu di-de-rqura santimetra
I.GEN 1 father(I) I.OBL - ALOC - LAT twenty.OBL centimeter.IN
 Ø-oxoru goì
 I -longbe
 ‘My father is 20 cm taller than me.’
 b. iyo-y bišar-eg r-u:-ho zonzo
 mother-ERG food(V) V-well V-do-PRS REFL . SG . GEN 2
 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140
(1302)a. obu-de-r q’ w ena ňeb-aØ-Ü eži zoq’e-n hago
father-ALOC - LAT two.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be-UWPST he
 ‘He was two years older than my father.’ (N)
 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.

The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).

Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).

is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

6.11. Word order
There are no restrictions on the internal order of adjectives, i.e. in a sequence
of two or more adjectives the order is completely free (302). Adjectives usually
precede their head, but the reverse order is also acceptable.
(302) r-Ü eži maÜarul xaliča / maÜarul r-Ü eži xaliča
 V -big Avarcarpet(V) / Avar V -big carpet(V )

 The order of adverbs and adjectives is fixed: the adverb must precede the
adjective (303a, 303b). A detailed analysis of the word order of nouns and their
attributes is given in Section 27.2.

Verbal inflection
7.1. Introduction
Verbs consist of a root that can be preceded by an agreement prefix and followed
by various suffixes. In the simplest case a verb can consist of the root only, e.g.
nox ‘come.IMP’ / ‘come.GT’. Categories marked on the verb are: tense, aspect,
mood, evidentiality, polarity, illocutionary force, gender, and number. The cat-
egories of gender and number are fused in agreement prefixes. Hinuq verbs do
not show person agreement.

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).

 Free adjuncts, especially temporal adverbs, often appear in clause initial
position (1374a, 1374b), and spatial, directional, and manner adverbs show a
greater tendency for clause-medial position between S or A and P or the verb,
but clause-initial position is also quite common. Clauses beginning with seda za-
manaì often introduce new referents, and therefore have VS or AVP word order
(1374b).

In general, word orders that deviate from the most frequent patterns are as-
sociated with particular pragmatic meanings. In Section 29.2, a more detailed
account of the various word orders, their frequencies, and their information struc-
tures can be found.
27.3.2. Subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, verb-final word order is almost obligatory, e.g. (1375a)
shows a relative clause, and (1375b) an adverbial clause. Adverbial clauses that
violate this condition are attested, but they are not very frequent (see Section
21.4 for examples). Complement clauses where the verb is not in clause final
position can be elicited (1375c, 1375d), but I did not find any examples in my
corpus. They carry a special information structure since the element in clause
final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other
than clause-final are ungrammatical.

Questions
28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).
(1376) a. merazigoì=e xem-za-qo=nØ-ece-n

you.PL . ERG I.OBL - AT tell-INF allow.V. ICVB be.NEG = Q
‘Are you not allowed to tell me that?’ (N)
 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.
(1342) a. det’ek t’ot’r-iš žurnal-zomoča:
 I.ERG book read-PST journal-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I read the book instead of the journal.’
 b. det’ek t’ot’r-iš essu-zo moča:
 I.ERG book read-PST brother-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I instead of my brother read the book.’
26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a

Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).

Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).

Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.

 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.

‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš

‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo

‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).
","Chapter 27
Word order
27.1. Introduction
Hinuq is a head-final language at the phrase level as well as at the clause level.
At the clausal level, word order in main clauses is considerably more variable
than word order in subordinate clauses. Apart from this, word order is largely
determined by pragmatics.
27.2. Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase
Noun phrases are head-final. All types of modifiers precede their heads: demon-
stratives (1351a), adjective phrases (1351c), numerals and other types of quanti-
fiers (1351b, 1351d), Genitive noun phrases (1351a, 1351b), and relative clauses
(1351d).
(1351)a. haw di iyo
that I.GEN 1 mother
‘that mother of mine’ (N)
b. xan-es ìono uži
khan-GEN 1 three son
‘the khan’s three sons’ (N)
c. hes c’uddu [mali-šiyb-iìi]gulu
one rednose.OBL - GEN 1 blood(III) III-similar horse(III)
‘one horse, red like the nose’s blood’ (N)
d. [t’ot’er-ho goìa] boň’arab žo
read-ICVB be.PTCP any.desired thing
‘all desired things that (he) read’ (N)
 This also includes complex modifiers like the equative phrase in (1351c),
which consists itself of a particle with a Genitive phrase, or local modifiers. In
(1352) a Genitive, a spatial modifier, and an adjective phrase precede the head
noun.
(1352) xiriyaw kirpič-mo-saň-a bišun b-Ü eži buňe
 expensive brick-OBL - GEN 1 village-IN most III-big house(III)
 ‘the biggest house in the village (made of) expensive bricks’
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase731
The order of modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free. In short
noun phrases with only two modifiers, native speakers accept most possible or-
ders. For example, instead of having the possessor preceding the numeral as in
(1351b) above, the reverse order is also possible. The same is true for the order
of numeral and demonstratives or adjectives: both orders are readily accepted
(1353b, 1353c).
(1353) a. q’ono=n zones omoq’i=n
 two=and REFL . SG . GEN 1 donkey=and
 ‘and two of his donkeys’ (N)
 b. ìono had t’ek / had ìono t’ek
 three these book / these three book
 ‘these three books’
 c. ìono y-egiy t’ek / y-egiy ìono t’ek
 three IV-good book(IV) / IV-good three book(IV)
 ‘three good books’
Similarly, although possessor pronouns far more frequently follow demon-
stratives (1351a), the other way around is also attested (1354a). The order of
adjectives and demonstratives in the noun phrase is variable (1354b). The exam-
ple in (1354c) shows a long noun phrase consisting of the head noun modified
by a quantifier, a numeral, and two possessors, one of them a pronoun and the
other a Genitive phrase.
(1354) a. debe haw buňe
 you.SG . GEN 1 that house
 ‘that house of yours’ (N)
 b. očordiyu hado rek’ w e / hado očordiyu rek’ w e
 oldthis man / this oldman
 ‘this old man’
 c. č’ek’k’u=tow ìono=n haìo-s[ked-zo] obu-s
 all=EMPHthree=and this.OBL - GEN 1 girl-GEN 2 father- GEN 1
 suPal-be
 question-PL
 ‘all three of his, the girl’s father’s, questions’ (N)
27.2.1. Scope properties in noun phrases with two modifiers
In many cases of noun phrases with two (or more) modifiers, the order is flexible
and there is no perceivable difference in meaning, but there is a difference in
732 Chapter 27. Word order
frequency; e.g. in (1353c) both order are fine, but the first order is more com-
mon. In other cases there may be semantic differences between different orders
reflecting different scope relations, especially when Genitives and other modi-
fiers are combined. Thus, modifiers preceding the Genitive can be interpreted as
either belonging to the Genitive or to the head of the Genitive (1355a, 1355b).
Pragmatics can play a role in such cases, e.g. in (1355b) the second reading is
more easily available since it is more common to speak of the beauty of a woman
than of a man’s beauty.
(1355) a. č’ek’k’u aň-a-za-s kedbi
 all village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 girl.PL
 ‘girls of all villages’ or ‘all girls from the villages’
b. bercinaw-ni Maèama-s ked
 beautiful-ATT Mahama-GEN 1 daughter
 ‘the daughter of the beautiful Mahama’ or ‘Mahama’s beautiful daugh-
 ter’
 In contrast, if the Genitive precedes the second modifier, then both are inter-
preted as belonging to the following head:
(1356) a. aň-a-za-s č’ek’k’u kedbi
 village-OBL - OBL . PL - GEN 1 all girl.PL
 ‘all girls from the villages’
b. Maèama-sbercinaw-ni essu
 Mahama-GEN 1 beautiful-ATT sister
 ‘Mahama’s beautiful sister’
27.2.2. Word order in the Genitive phrase
Hinuq has two Genitive cases. The First Genitive case is used for head nouns
in the Absolutive case, and the Second Genitive case is used in all other con-
texts (see Section 3.5.4 for more details on the Genitive). The Genitive normally
precedes the head noun and other modifiers like adjectives (1357a), quantifiers
(1357b), numerals, and demonstratives (1357c).
(1357) a. geni-mo-sr-ežinnu karzina
 pear-OBL - GEN 1 V-big basket(V)
 ‘a big basket of pears’ (S)
b. hayìo-s č’ek’k’u k’it’ri-be
 he.OBL - GEN 1 allcucumber-PL
 ‘all his cucumbers’ (N)
 Word order in the noun phrase and in the postpositional phrase 733
 c. qazaq-zohayìu xun-za-ň’o
 Georgian-GEN 2 that.OBL mountain- OBL . PL - SPR
 ‘on that Georgian mountain’ (N)
Phrases in which the Genitive follows the head noun are only very occa-
sionally attested in my corpus, although direct elicitation fails in these cases.
A Genitive following the head noun may be interrupted by other material (see
Section 27.2.4 below on discontinuous word order).
(1358)a. hes taypa ahlu-mo-s
 one clan folk-OBL - GEN 1
 ‘one group of people’ (N)
 b. had essni haìo-s
 these brother.PL he.OBL - GEN 1
 ‘these brothers of his’ (N)
 c. mežu-qo-r hari goì di, [de Ø-uhe-nos] ...
 you.PL . OBL - AT- LAT request be I.GEN 1 I I-die-ANT
 ‘my only request for you is, after I (masc.) die ...’ (N)
In complex noun phrases with many modifiers, the Genitive frequently ap-
pears in the first position (1357a-1357c), (1359a). The reason is that modifiers
preceding the Genitive may in principle be interpreted as referring to the Genitive
(see (1355a) and (1355b) above). Numerals or adjectives may also precede the
Genitive (1359b), but ‘mixing’ is forbidden, i.e. inserting the Genitive between
the other modifiers (1359c).

 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.

26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).

Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).

Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.

In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the

quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,

suffixes to both noun phrases:

For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

final position is highlighted. Relative clauses with the verb in a position other

28.1. Introduction
Hinuq has Interrogative suffixes and a cognate Interrogative enclitic. The form
of the Interrogative suffix/enclitic is partially determined by phonological rules,
partially by the tense-aspect-mood form of the verb to which it is attached, and
partially by emphasis. For more information on these suffixes/enclitic see Sec-
tion 13.1.2.1. The use of the suffixes is obligatory in questions with past time
reference and the evidentiality meaning ‘neutral’ (e.g. Simple Past). The use of
the enclitic is optional and relatively common. Interrogative suffixes/enclitics
occur in polar and in WH-questions.
28.2. Polar questions
Polar questions (i.e. yes-no-questions) are normally marked with the Interrog-
ative suffix/enclitic added to the verb (1376b). In periphrastic verb forms the
marker appears on the last word of the verbal complex, i.e. the auxiliary (1376c).

 When the Interrogative marker appears on the finite verb, then the question
has a neutral information structure value (i.e. predicate-focus structure), where
the predicate represents the focus (1376a-1376c). But it is also possible to add
the enclitic to some other word. The consituent bearing the Interrogative enclitic
is always in focus (1377a, 1377b). More information on the information structure
of polar questions is provided in Section 29.3.2.

",68.66610717773438," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.

If the embedded verb is intransitive, then it is impossible to say whether the
construction represents forward or backward control.

 ‘The drummer began to shout.’ (N)
For Tsez, Polinsky and Potsdam (2002) show that backward control repre-
sents a biclausal construction and not a monoclausal clause union construction.
In Hinuq not all of their arguments are applicable. Besides case assignment and
agreement, at least word order can be interpreted as pointing to a biclausal con-
struction. In (1182), which represents backward control, it is impossible for an
argument of the embedded clause to occur before the matrix verb in clause-initial
position.
(1182) * Maèama-y huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I)-ERG yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
(Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.)
In contrast, (1183) represents the ordinary word order because the most
prominent argument is part of the matrix clause and precedes the matrix clause
verb.
(1183) Maèama huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I) yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
‘Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.’
That the matrix clause contains a covert agreement trigger can only be proven
by the agreement on the matrix verb. Apart form Hinuq and Tsez, backward
control exists in a few other Daghestanian languages like Tsez, Rutul (Kibrik
2003: 533), and Tsakhur (Kibrik 2003: 547), (Ljutikova & Bonč-Osmolovskaja
1999: 532); in these languages usually the phasal verb ‘begin, start’ and/or the
modal verb ‘must’ appear in this construction. Other languages outside of Dagh-
estan that exhibit backward control are Japanese, Brazilian Portugese, Korean,
and Kabardian (Polinsky & Potsdam 2006).
22.5. Summary of agreement and case assignment in complements
When looking at the patterns of agreement and case assignment in complement
clauses, there seem to be five possibilities (Table 84). The most prominent argu-
ment of the matrix clause can either have its case assigned by the matrix verb
Complement-taking adjectives, adverbs, and nouns649
itself or by the subordinate verb. However, as the example of k’ w ezi -iq- ‘be
able’ above shows (Section 22.4.6), the valency frame of the subordinate verb
can influence the case assignment of the matrix verb.

28.3. WH-questions
WH-questions (=content questions, constituent questions, parametric questions)
use interrogative pronouns (Section 5.5). The phrase containing the interrogative
pronoun is usually either in preverbal position (1389a) or in clause-initial posi-
tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the
verb (1389c). Again, the word order is predominantly verb-final, but other orders
are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)

 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n

who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez

But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).

WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).

In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).

29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.

21.4. Word order and extraction
By far the preferred order for temporal and non-temporal converbs is to pre-
cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.

‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.

‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it

Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.

 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).

Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 ‘In that village there is a khan, and he is ill.’ (N)
 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)
 ‘A small child is coming to him.’ (S)
 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez
I.OBL - GEN 2 father-ERG what three ORD question you.SG . DAT
neň-i?

‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”
who-DAT III-want-PRS = QUOT say-CVB monkey(III)
‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?

‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other

WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).

 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’

 b. hag čurGan ìi?

 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?

 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?

 ‘Who did not go to school?’

29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.
",71.25212860107422,"14 Chapter 1. Introduction
The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new
loans, including all internationalisms are borrowed from Russian. An illustrative
list is given in (5). The influence from Russian is especially obvious in trans-
lations from Russian into Hinuq, which not only contain more Russian words
than natural discourse, but also show alternations in the syntax. For instance, the
word order in Russian is predominantly agent-verb-patient, but in Hinuq it is
agent-patient-verb. Another example is the use of nouns marked for plural after
all numbers except for the numeral 1, which is the norm in Russian, but not in
Hinuq (in Hinuq normally the singular is used).

29.2.5. Clause-initial position of the verbal complex
In practice, the word order in verb-initial clauses is always VAP. Of sentences
with VPA word order, though possible, I did not find clear examples in my
corpus.145 Testelec (1998b) claims that in Daghestanian languages verb-initial
clauses are contrastive and occur if the action denoted by the relevant verb is
contrasted with some other action. In fact, there seem to be a few such cases in
my corpus where predicates are contrastive and thus occur clause-initially, e.g. in
(1421a) two actions (reading and knowing) are contrasted with each other. Both
145 There may well be one or two such examples, but the only VAP-like sentence that I
came across seems to be rather a right detachment construction.

the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.
"," * Maèama-y Murad oPocu b-uher-er-hogoì
Mahama-ERG Murat chicken(III) III-kill-CAUS - ICVB be
(Mahama makes Murat kill the chicken.)
The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).
(948)a. hayìoy močigoì b-eň-o
he.ERG field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
‘It is the field that he is ploughing.’
 b. * hago močigoì b-eň-o
he field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
(It is the field that he is ploughing.)
 Biabsolutive constructions 525
Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).
(949)a. * obu močižiqu b-eň-ogoì
 father field(III) today III-plough-ICVB be
 (The father ploughs the field today.)
 b.hago magalu ked-ez toňňo goì
 he bread girl-DAT give.ICVB be
 ‘He gives the girl bread.’
Similarly, the patient cannot undergo left (950a) or right dislocation (950b).
This is only possible in the Ergative construction.
(950)a. * c’inda-be iyo r-u:-ho goì
 socks-PL mother NHPL-do-ICVB be
 (It is knitted socks that the mother makes.)
 b. * iyo r-u:-ho goì c’inda-be
 mother NHPL-do-ICVB be socks-PL
 (Mother makes knitted socks.)
Consequently, in the biabsolutive construction, the patient and the lexical
verb form a tight unit which can hardly ever be interrupted. So the word order
is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

28.3. WH-questions
WH-questions (=content questions, constituent questions, parametric questions)
use interrogative pronouns (Section 5.5). The phrase containing the interrogative
pronoun is usually either in preverbal position (1389a) or in clause-initial posi-
tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the
verb (1389c). Again, the word order is predominantly verb-final, but other orders
are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).
(1389) a. di kednixece-y meži?
",68.30667114257812," Just as verbs in other clause types, the copula most frequently occurs in
clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì
house(III) III-big be
‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’
b. hadu ked c’aq’=tow bercinaw zeq’ w e-n

Copula clauses with nominal predicates531

c. Üumru=n b-egiy zoq’e-s elu-shayteì
 life(III)=and III-good be-PST we.OBL - GEN 1 there
 ‘And our life there was good.’ (N)
Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).

 well this bag-PLmoney- OBL - GEN 1 NHPL-fill-RES be
 ‘Well, these bags are filled with money.’ (N)
18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.

 ‘My father was a guard, my mother was a milkmaid.’ (N)
Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).

 ‘That the girl read the book is good.’
18.3.2. The predicate is in an oblique case
The predicate noun phrase can take various case markers according to its func-
tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).
(962) a. hibadi goìa beňe-s žo=n debez

 ‘If (you) stop not giving (it to me), shame on you.’ (N)
When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).
(963) a. debek w ezey-be mesed-li-š goì

 ‘My husband is from a rich family.’
Locative copula clauses533
c. had kaGat Pat’imat-ň’o-r goì
 this letter Patimat-SPR - LAT be
 ‘This letter is for Patimat.’
18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).
(964) a. boň’uq piq=nor-iči-yozoq’e-s

 ‘There were all possible kinds of fruits.’ (N)
 b. hes zoq’e-n miskin rek’ w e
 one be-UWPST poor man
 ‘There was one poor man.’ (N)
18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì
 in.one.place house.IN mouse be
 ‘In one place, in a house there is a mouse.’ or ‘A mouse is on one
 place, in a house.’ (N)

c. Čačan-ň’ozoq’ w e-s sadaq aldiyu buňe-be
 Chechnya-SPR be-PST all white house-PL
 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.
",69.54826354980469," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.

 ‘The king died.’

29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).

 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC

 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)

29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez

‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”

‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.

The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).

 Biabsolutive constructions 525
Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).

Similarly, the patient cannot undergo left (950a) or right dislocation (950b).
This is only possible in the Ergative construction.

 b. * iyo r-u:-ho goì c’inda-be

Consequently, in the biabsolutive construction, the patient and the lexical
verb form a tight unit which can hardly ever be interrupted. So the word order
is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

28.3. WH-questions
WH-questions (=content questions, constituent questions, parametric questions)
use interrogative pronouns (Section 5.5). The phrase containing the interrogative
pronoun is usually either in preverbal position (1389a) or in clause-initial posi-
tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the
verb (1389c). Again, the word order is predominantly verb-final, but other orders
are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).
(1300) a. diessu dew-zo essu-de-r bercinaw goì
I.GEN 1 sister you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 sister-ALOC - LAT beautiful be

 Comparative constructions 709
 b. dew-zoessu-de-r diessu bercinaw goì
 you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 I.GEN 1 sister sister- ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).

 mother-ERG food(V) V-well V-do-PRS REFL . SG . GEN 2
 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140
(1302)a. obu-de-r q’ w ena ňeb-aØ-Ü eži zoq’e-n hago
father-ALOC - LAT two.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be-UWPST he

 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.

are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order

is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).
(974) a. zekìer-oč’č’u r-iči / r-ič-agoì
 tomorrow water( V) V-cold V-be / V-be- INF be
 ‘Tomorrow the water will be warm.’
b. neten de y-iči-yo q’ede!
 always I II-be-PRS IRR
 ‘May I (fem.) always be!’ (i.e. live forever)
Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).
(975) a. “ilbis b-iq-iš goì dewzo
 devil(III) III-become-PST be you.SG . GEN 2

 I I-big I-become-ANT I I-become-INF be hunter=as
 ‘When I (masc.) grow up I will become a hunter.’
If in ‘X becomes Y’ the Y is an adverb or adjective, the noun phrase denoting
the subject X is in the Absolutive case and triggers agreement:
(976) a. miskinaw Malla Rasadan bečed Ø-iqqo
 poorMullah Nasredin rich I-become.PRS
 ‘The poor Mullah Nasredin becomes rich.’ (N)
b. hibay haw č’agu y-iq-iš goì, haw ked
 there she alive II-become-RES be that girl(II)
 ‘There she becomes alive, that girl.’ (N)
Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.
(977) a. hayìu-qo y-ese q’ono qu=čeňebu

 ‘She is probably about forty years old.’
b. zek r-oč’č’u r-eser-ič-aG w ede

 ‘Tomorrow will probably be a cold day.’
538 Chapter 18. Copula clauses
Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).
"," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.

 you.SG . DAT V-like-PRS mother-GEN 1= Q khinkal-PL
 ‘Do you like MOTHER’S khinkal?’
The word order in polar questions is the same as in assertions, i.e. predom-
inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).
(1382) a. Üali q’idi Ø-iči-š goì=e paradala:?
",67.27686309814453,"The biabsolutive construction can be interpreted as a means of decreasing
the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.

The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new
loans, including all internationalisms are borrowed from Russian. An illustrative
list is given in (5). The influence from Russian is especially obvious in trans-
lations from Russian into Hinuq, which not only contain more Russian words
than natural discourse, but also show alternations in the syntax. For instance, the
word order in Russian is predominantly agent-verb-patient, but in Hinuq it is
agent-patient-verb. Another example is the use of nouns marked for plural after
all numbers except for the numeral 1, which is the norm in Russian, but not in
Hinuq (in Hinuq normally the singular is used).

The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new

Mahama-ERG Murat chicken(III) III-kill-CAUS - ICVB be
(Mahama makes Murat kill the chicken.)
The next constraint concerns the order of auxiliary and lexical verb, which
can be changed in the ergative construction in order to focus the patient (948a ).
In contrast, in the biabsolutive construction, this order is fixed (948b).
(948)a. hayìoy močigoì b-eň-o
he.ERG field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
‘It is the field that he is ploughing.’
 b. * hago močigoì b-eň-o
he field(III) be III-plough-ICVB
(It is the field that he is ploughing.)
 Biabsolutive constructions 525
Second, in the biabsolutive construction, nothing can be inserted between
the patient and the lexical verb - at least not with transitive lexical verbs (949a).
Ditransitive verbs allow the beneficiary to be inserted between the patient and
the lexical verb (949b).
(949)a. * obu močižiqu b-eň-ogoì
 father field(III) today III-plough-ICVB be
 (The father ploughs the field today.)
 b.hago magalu ked-ez toňňo goì
 he bread girl-DAT give.ICVB be
 ‘He gives the girl bread.’
Similarly, the patient cannot undergo left (950a) or right dislocation (950b).
This is only possible in the Ergative construction.
(950)a. * c’inda-be iyo r-u:-ho goì
 socks-PL mother NHPL-do-ICVB be
 (It is knitted socks that the mother makes.)
 b. * iyo r-u:-ho goì c’inda-be
 mother NHPL-do-ICVB be socks-PL
 (Mother makes knitted socks.)
Consequently, in the biabsolutive construction, the patient and the lexical
verb form a tight unit which can hardly ever be interrupted. So the word order
is partly fixed. In contrast, in the ergative construction, the word order is less
restricted; various elements can be inserted between the patient and the lexical
verb. The single argument in the Absolutive case is interpreted as the patient,
independently of its position in the clause.

inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 ‘In that village there is a khan, and he is ill.’ (N)
 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)
 ‘A small child is coming to him.’ (S)
 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez
I.OBL - GEN 2 father-ERG what three ORD question you.SG . DAT
neň-i?
give-Q
‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”
who-DAT III-want-PRS = QUOT say-CVB monkey(III)
‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.
(1438)a. se r-uw-anhaìouži-ž, Ø-uher-an=ehado?

‘Where did you get this from? Was it the KHAN, who gave it (to
you)?’ (N)
29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).
(1300) a. diessu dew-zo essu-de-r bercinaw goì

 b. dew-zoessu-de-r diessu bercinaw goì
 you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 I.GEN 1 sister sister- ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).
(1301)a. di obu di-de-rqura santimetra

 mother-ERG food(V) V-well V-do-PRS REFL . SG . GEN 2
 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140
(1302)a. obu-de-r q’ w ena ňeb-aØ-Ü eži zoq’e-n hago
father-ALOC - LAT two.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be-UWPST he
 ‘He was two years older than my father.’ (N)
 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.

grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).

 b. dew-zoessu-de-r diessu bercinaw goì
 you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 I.GEN 1 sister sister- ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).

 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140
(1302)a. obu-de-r q’ w ena ňeb-aØ-Ü eži zoq’e-n hago
father-ALOC - LAT two.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be-UWPST he

 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.

28.3. WH-questions
WH-questions (=content questions, constituent questions, parametric questions)
use interrogative pronouns (Section 5.5). The phrase containing the interrogative
pronoun is usually either in preverbal position (1389a) or in clause-initial posi-
tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the
verb (1389c). Again, the word order is predominantly verb-final, but other orders
are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).

the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.

cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.

The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new
loans, including all internationalisms are borrowed from Russian. An illustrative
list is given in (5). The influence from Russian is especially obvious in trans-
lations from Russian into Hinuq, which not only contain more Russian words
than natural discourse, but also show alternations in the syntax. For instance, the
word order in Russian is predominantly agent-verb-patient, but in Hinuq it is
agent-patient-verb. Another example is the use of nouns marked for plural after
all numbers except for the numeral 1, which is the norm in Russian, but not in
Hinuq (in Hinuq normally the singular is used).

tion (1389b), or occasionally in another position (1398c). It can never follow the

are also grammatical (see Section 29.3.1 for more information on the word order
in WH-questions and the pragmatics related to different word orders).
(1389) a. di kednixece-y meži?
",tensor([33.0931])," Just as verbs in other clause types, the copula most frequently occurs in
clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì

‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’

c. Üumru=n b-egiy zoq’e-s elu-shayteì
 life(III)=and III-good be-PST we.OBL - GEN 1 there
 ‘And our life there was good.’ (N)
Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).

18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.

Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).

18.3.2. The predicate is in an oblique case
The predicate noun phrase can take various case markers according to its func-
tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).

 ‘If (you) stop not giving (it to me), shame on you.’ (N)
When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).

c. had kaGat Pat’imat-ň’o-r goì

18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).

 ‘There was one poor man.’ (N)
18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì

 ‘In one place, in a house there is a mouse.’ or ‘A mouse is on one
 place, in a house.’ (N)

 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.

phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.
",70.3233642578125,"726 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.
(1342) a. det’ek t’ot’r-iš žurnal-zomoča:
 I.ERG book read-PST journal-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I read the book instead of the journal.’
 b. det’ek t’ot’r-iš essu-zo moča:
 I.ERG book read-PST brother-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I instead of my brother read the book.’
26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.
(1343) a. seda zaman-a-ìèapiz Üumar essuØ-iň’i-yo
 one.OBL time-OBL - CONT Hapiz Umar brother(I) I-go-PRS
 Yiq’o-do hayìi qazaq-za-ì-er

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).
(1344)a. q’orol aqila-y xan-eskedsweru
widow woman.OBL - ERG khan-GEN 1 daughter(II ) around
y-aGi-yo
II-open- PRS
‘The widow made the khan’s daughter tell everything (lit. open her
around).’ (N)
b. hibayìo rek’u-zo, exo rek’u-de-r

house.OBL - ILOC - LAT V-half at.night HPL -go-PRS they
‘At midnight they go to that man – the shepherd’s house.’ (N)
Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).
(1345) hayìo èabib èaži obu-szoq’e-s goì ìeno uži=n hes
 that.OBL Habib Gadzhi father-GEN 1 be-RES be five son=and one
 ked=no
 daughter=and
 ‘Father Habib Gadzhi had five sons and one daughter.’ (N)
Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.
(1346) hezzo-r Ø-oxer-nohado. askarbit=no Ø-u:-n di
 back-LAT I-drive.away-UWPST he insult=and I-do-CVB I.GEN 1
 hago Ø-Ü ežinnu obu Maèama èaži
 that I-oldfather(I) Mahama Gadzhi
 ‘(They) threw him out and offended my grandfather Mahama Gadzhi.’
 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.
(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father(I) Mohamed Gadzhi.ERG
[caňi-n] mihna=tow b-aq’er-no geì q’idi-r
throw-CVB bird(III)=EMPH III-bring-UWPST down down-LAT
‘My grandfather Mohamed Gadzhi shot and brought the bird itself
down.’ (N)
b. di-žo Ø-Ü ežinnu obu èapiz Üumar-es essu Pari=ňen
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.
(1342) a. det’ek t’ot’r-iš žurnal-zomoča:

26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.
(1343) a. seda zaman-a-ìèapiz Üumar essuØ-iň’i-yo

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).
(1344)a. q’orol aqila-y xan-eskedsweru
widow woman.OBL - ERG khan-GEN 1 daughter(II ) around
y-aGi-yo
II-open- PRS
‘The widow made the khan’s daughter tell everything (lit. open her
around).’ (N)
b. hibayìo rek’u-zo, exo rek’u-de-r

house.OBL - ILOC - LAT V-half at.night HPL -go-PRS they
‘At midnight they go to that man – the shepherd’s house.’ (N)
Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).
(1345) hayìo èabib èaži obu-szoq’e-s goì ìeno uži=n hes
 that.OBL Habib Gadzhi father-GEN 1 be-RES be five son=and one
 ked=no
 daughter=and
 ‘Father Habib Gadzhi had five sons and one daughter.’ (N)
Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.
(1346) hezzo-r Ø-oxer-nohado. askarbit=no Ø-u:-n di
 back-LAT I-drive.away-UWPST he insult=and I-do-CVB I.GEN 1
 hago Ø-Ü ežinnu obu Maèama èaži
 that I-oldfather(I) Mahama Gadzhi
 ‘(They) threw him out and offended my grandfather Mahama Gadzhi.’
 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.
(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father(I) Mohamed Gadzhi.ERG
[caňi-n] mihna=tow b-aq’er-no geì q’idi-r

‘My grandfather Mohamed Gadzhi shot and brought the bird itself
down.’ (N)
b. di-žo Ø-Ü ežinnu obu èapiz Üumar-es essu Pari=ňen
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).
",66.30013275146484,"648 Chapter 22. Complement clauses
If the embedded verb is intransitive, then it is impossible to say whether the
construction represents forward or backward control.
(1181) qaňe-li:-ž Ø-uìi-š=eňq’iliqan
shout-ANTIP - PURP I-begin-PST = NARR drummer(I)
 ‘The drummer began to shout.’ (N)
For Tsez, Polinsky and Potsdam (2002) show that backward control repre-
sents a biclausal construction and not a monoclausal clause union construction.
In Hinuq not all of their arguments are applicable. Besides case assignment and
agreement, at least word order can be interpreted as pointing to a biclausal con-
struction. In (1182), which represents backward control, it is impossible for an
argument of the embedded clause to occur before the matrix verb in clause-initial
position.
(1182) * Maèama-y huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I)-ERG yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
(Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.)
In contrast, (1183) represents the ordinary word order because the most
prominent argument is part of the matrix clause and precedes the matrix clause
verb.
(1183) Maèama huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I) yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
‘Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.’
That the matrix clause contains a covert agreement trigger can only be proven
by the agreement on the matrix verb. Apart form Hinuq and Tsez, backward
control exists in a few other Daghestanian languages like Tsez, Rutul (Kibrik
2003: 533), and Tsakhur (Kibrik 2003: 547), (Ljutikova & Bonč-Osmolovskaja
1999: 532); in these languages usually the phasal verb ‘begin, start’ and/or the
modal verb ‘must’ appear in this construction. Other languages outside of Dagh-
estan that exhibit backward control are Japanese, Brazilian Portugese, Korean,
and Kabardian (Polinsky & Potsdam 2006).
22.5. Summary of agreement and case assignment in complements
When looking at the patterns of agreement and case assignment in complement
clauses, there seem to be five possibilities (Table 84). The most prominent argu-
ment of the matrix clause can either have its case assigned by the matrix verb
Complement-taking adjectives, adverbs, and nouns649
itself or by the subordinate verb. However, as the example of k’ w ezi -iq- ‘be
able’ above shows (Section 22.4.6), the valency frame of the subordinate verb
can influence the case assignment of the matrix verb.

(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father(I) Mohamed Gadzhi.ERG
[caňi-n] mihna=tow b-aq’er-no geì q’idi-r
throw-CVB bird(III)=EMPH III-bring-UWPST down down-LAT
‘My grandfather Mohamed Gadzhi shot and brought the bird itself
down.’ (N)
b. di-žo Ø-Ü ežinnu obu èapiz Üumar-es essu Pari=ňen
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).
",tensor([33.0775]),"744 Chapter 28. Questions
(1380) a. debezr-eti-yoiyo-sxok’o-be?
 you.SG . DAT NHPL-want-PRS mother-GEN 1 khinkal-PL
‘Do you love mother’s khinkal?’
b. hadi goì uži=n ňoči=n G w e=n. b-ik-oho?
here be boy=and frog=and dog=and HPL-see-PRS
‘Here are a boy, a frog, and a dog. Do you see them?’ (S)
As in all other verbal forms, the Interrogative enclitic appears on focused
referents in questions coded with the Simple Present. Compare (1380a) above
with the following example:
(1381) debezr-eti-yoiyo-s=e xok’o-be?
 you.SG . DAT V-like-PRS mother-GEN 1= Q khinkal-PL
 ‘Do you like MOTHER’S khinkal?’
The word order in polar questions is the same as in assertions, i.e. predom-
inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).
(1270) ahlu sedi.sed-qo b-ihi:-š

 ‘The people fought against each other.’
The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

11.2.8. aldoGo ‘in front of’
The postposition aldoGo can be used with three cases leading always to the spa-
tial meaning ‘in front of’, namely the CONT-Essive (682a), the ALOC-Essive
(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

This postposition, an Avar loan word, governs the ILOC-Essive with inanimate
nouns (683a) and the ALOC-Essive with animate nouns (683b, 683c). It can have
a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance
Spatial postpositions387
‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.

‘Here are a boy, a frog, and a dog. Do you see them?’ (S)
As in all other verbal forms, the Interrogative enclitic appears on focused
referents in questions coded with the Simple Present. Compare (1380a) above
with the following example:
(1381) debezr-eti-yoiyo-s=e xok’o-be?
 you.SG . DAT V-like-PRS mother-GEN 1= Q khinkal-PL
 ‘Do you like MOTHER’S khinkal?’
The word order in polar questions is the same as in assertions, i.e. predom-
inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).

",67.65591430664062," Just as verbs in other clause types, the copula most frequently occurs in
clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì
house(III) III-big be
‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’
b. hadu ked c’aq’=tow bercinaw zeq’ w e-n
this girl very=EMPH beautiful be-UWPST
Copula clauses with nominal predicates531
 ‘This girl was very beautiful.’ (N)
c. Üumru=n b-egiy zoq’e-s elu-shayteì
 life(III)=and III-good be-PST we.OBL - GEN 1 there
 ‘And our life there was good.’ (N)
Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).
(959) hale hibad mušuk’i-be mecxer-o-sr-ič’-išgoì
 well this bag-PLmoney- OBL - GEN 1 NHPL-fill-RES be
 ‘Well, these bags are filled with money.’ (N)
18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.
(960) a. Malla Rasadan-ieňi-n, “hadu dišayix goì”=ňen
 Mullah Nasredin-ERG say-UWPST this I.GEN 1 saint be=QUOT
 ‘Malla Rasan said, “This is my saint.”’ (N)
b. me eli aqili goì

 ‘You are our woman.’ (N)
c. čanaqan zoq’ w e-s Üali

 ‘Ali was a hunter.’
d. Abdukarim èaži Buynaksk šahar-mo-simam goì
 Abdukarim Gadzhi Buynaksk town-OBL - GEN 1 imam be
 ‘Abdurkarim Gadzhi is the imam of Buynaksk.’ (N)
532 Chapter 18. Copula clauses
e. obu zoq’e-s axran. iyozoq’e-s dayarka
 father be-PST guard mother be-PST milkmaid
 ‘My father was a guard, my mother was a milkmaid.’ (N)
Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).
(961) a. di Gira zoq’e-s èažb-uw-a / b-uw-ayaz
 I.GEN 1 wish be-PST Hajj(III) III-do-INF / III-do-PURP
 ‘It was my dream to go on the Hajj.’
b. [ked-i t’ek t’ot’er-iš-ìi]r-eg goì
 girl-ERG book read-RES - ABST V-well BE
 ‘That the girl read the book is good.’
18.3.2. The predicate is in an oblique case
The predicate noun phrase can take various case markers according to its func-
tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).
(962) a. hibadi goìa beňe-s žo=n debez
 here be.PTCP house.OBL - GEN 1 thing( V)=and you.SG . DAT
 r-ič-agoì
 V -be-INF be
 ‘The things here in the house will be for you.’ (N)
b. [neň-mez=gonxece-yo] munaè debezgoì
 give-PURP. NEG = TOP stop-COND sin you.SG . DAT be
 ‘If (you) stop not giving (it to me), shame on you.’ (N)
When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).
(963) a. debek w ezey-be mesed-li-š goì
 you.SG . GEN 1 hand-PL gold-OBL - GEN 1 be
 ‘Your hands are from gold.’
b. di xoddo bečedaw haq’u-ì-es goì
 I.GEN 1 husband rich family-CONT- ABL 1 be
 ‘My husband is from a rich family.’
Locative copula clauses533
c. had kaGat Pat’imat-ň’o-r goì
 this letter Patimat-SPR - LAT be
 ‘This letter is for Patimat.’
18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).
(964) a. boň’uq piq=nor-iči-yozoq’e-s
 at.will fruit(V)=and V-be- ICVB be-PST
 ‘There were all possible kinds of fruits.’ (N)
 b. hes zoq’e-n miskin rek’ w e
 one be-UWPST poor man
 ‘There was one poor man.’ (N)
18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì
 in.one.place house.IN mouse be
 ‘In one place, in a house there is a mouse.’ or ‘A mouse is on one
 place, in a house.’ (N)
Ü
 b. ardel elu-deaši šayt’an-be zoq’e-s=ňen
 formerly we. OBL - ALOC many devil-PL be-PST = QUOT
 ‘Formerly in our village there were many devils.’ or ‘Formerly many
 devils were in our village.’ (N)
c. Čačan-ň’ozoq’ w e-s sadaq aldiyu buňe-be
 Chechnya-SPR be-PST all white house-PL
 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.
",tensor([31.9379])," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.
",tensor([33.7764]),"744 Chapter 28. Questions
(1380) a. debezr-eti-yoiyo-sxok’o-be?
 you.SG . DAT NHPL-want-PRS mother-GEN 1 khinkal-PL
‘Do you love mother’s khinkal?’
b. hadi goì uži=n ňoči=n G w e=n. b-ik-oho?
here be boy=and frog=and dog=and HPL-see-PRS
‘Here are a boy, a frog, and a dog. Do you see them?’ (S)
As in all other verbal forms, the Interrogative enclitic appears on focused
referents in questions coded with the Simple Present. Compare (1380a) above
with the following example:
(1381) debezr-eti-yoiyo-s=e xok’o-be?
 you.SG . DAT V-like-PRS mother-GEN 1= Q khinkal-PL
 ‘Do you like MOTHER’S khinkal?’
The word order in polar questions is the same as in assertions, i.e. predom-
inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).

 As in all clause types of Hinuq, the word order in complement clauses is
predominantly but not strictly head-final. Examples with head-final word order
can be found throughout this chapter. (1080) illustrates a complement clause
where the verb in the complement clause does not appear in the last position.

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.
(1222)a. zonzo=towi G w e-y Üumari Ø-uň’er-iš
 REFL . SG . GEN 2= SELF dog- ERG Omar(I ) I -frighten- PST

 he.OBL - GEN 2 dog-ERG Omar(I) I-frighten-PST
Reflexivization 671
 ‘His∗i/ j dog frightened Omari .’
If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).
(1223) a. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago∗i/ j Ø-uň’er-iš
Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG heI -frighten- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog frightened him∗i/ j .’
b. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago=towi/ j Ø-uň’er-iš
 Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG he=SELF I -frighten- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog frightened himi/ j .’
When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):
(1224) Üumar-esi G w e j zoni.zon-ň’o-r∗i/ j b-eze-s
 Omar-GEN 1 dog(III) RED . REFL . SG . OBL - SPR - LAT III-look- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog j looked at itself∗i/ j .’
When the simple reflexive pronoun is marked with =tow, then the possessor
functions as antecedent (1225). The enclitic cannot be left out because then the
sentence becomes incomprehensible (1216a).
(1225) Üumar-zoi G w e-y j zo=towi/∗ jhil-iš
 Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG REFL . SG = SELF bite-PST
 ‘Omar’si dog j bit himi/∗ j .’
24.1.2.4. Word order and reversal of roles
The word order of reflexive pronouns is in principle free, i.e. they usually follow
their antecedent, but the reversed order is also possible.
(1226) a. Šayix-izoni.zo zokko
Sheikh-ERG RED . REFL . SG beat.PRS

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).

11.2.8. aldoGo ‘in front of’
The postposition aldoGo can be used with three cases leading always to the spa-
tial meaning ‘in front of’, namely the CONT-Essive (682a), the ALOC-Essive
(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

11.2.9. dandi ‘towards, against’
This postposition, an Avar loan word, governs the ILOC-Essive with inanimate
nouns (683a) and the ALOC-Essive with animate nouns (683b, 683c). It can have
a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance
Spatial postpositions387
‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.

As in all other verbal forms, the Interrogative enclitic appears on focused
referents in questions coded with the Simple Present. Compare (1380a) above
with the following example:

 ‘Do you like MOTHER’S khinkal?’
The word order in polar questions is the same as in assertions, i.e. predom-
inantly verb-final, but all other word orders are also accepted. Also as in asser-
tions, focused constituents can be clefted (1382b).

 Word order in declarative main clauses 765
29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)
 ‘A small child is coming to him.’ (S)
 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez
I.OBL - GEN 2 father-ERG what three ORD question you.SG . DAT
neň-i?
give-Q
‘What third question did my father give to you?’ (N)
 b. “ìu-zb-eti-yo”=ňeneňi-n“maymalak?”
who-DAT III-want-PRS = QUOT say-CVB monkey(III)
‘“Who wants a monkey?” he said.’ (N)
 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.
",tensor([33.6221]),"726 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.
(1342) a. det’ek t’ot’r-iš žurnal-zomoča:
 I.ERG book read-PST journal-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I read the book instead of the journal.’
 b. det’ek t’ot’r-iš essu-zo moča:
 I.ERG book read-PST brother-GEN 2 place.IN
 ‘I instead of my brother read the book.’
26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).
(1344)a. q’orol aqila-y xan-eskedsweru
widow woman.OBL - ERG khan-GEN 1 daughter(II ) around
y-aGi-yo

‘The widow made the khan’s daughter tell everything (lit. open her

house.OBL - ILOC - LAT V-half at.night HPL -go-PRS they
‘At midnight they go to that man – the shepherd’s house.’ (N)
Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).
(1345) hayìo èabib èaži obu-szoq’e-s goì ìeno uži=n hes
 that.OBL Habib Gadzhi father-GEN 1 be-RES be five son=and one
 ked=no
 daughter=and
 ‘Father Habib Gadzhi had five sons and one daughter.’ (N)
Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.
(1346) hezzo-r Ø-oxer-nohado. askarbit=no Ø-u:-n di

 hago Ø-Ü ežinnu obu Maèama èaži
 that I-oldfather(I) Mahama Gadzhi
 ‘(They) threw him out and offended my grandfather Mahama Gadzhi.’
 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.
(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father(I) Mohamed Gadzhi.ERG
[caňi-n] mihna=tow b-aq’er-no geì q’idi-r

I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

11.2.8. aldoGo ‘in front of’
The postposition aldoGo can be used with three cases leading always to the spa-
tial meaning ‘in front of’, namely the CONT-Essive (682a), the ALOC-Essive
(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

11.2.9. dandi ‘towards, against’
This postposition, an Avar loan word, governs the ILOC-Essive with inanimate
nouns (683a) and the ALOC-Essive with animate nouns (683b, 683c). It can have
a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance
Spatial postpositions387
‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.
",69.71288299560547,"14 Chapter 1. Introduction
The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new
loans, including all internationalisms are borrowed from Russian. An illustrative
list is given in (5). The influence from Russian is especially obvious in trans-
lations from Russian into Hinuq, which not only contain more Russian words
than natural discourse, but also show alternations in the syntax. For instance, the
word order in Russian is predominantly agent-verb-patient, but in Hinuq it is
agent-patient-verb. Another example is the use of nouns marked for plural after
all numbers except for the numeral 1, which is the norm in Russian, but not in

 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.

26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).
(1344)a. q’orol aqila-y xan-eskedsweru

‘The widow made the khan’s daughter tell everything (lit. open her

house.OBL - ILOC - LAT V-half at.night HPL -go-PRS they
‘At midnight they go to that man – the shepherd’s house.’ (N)
Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).
(1345) hayìo èabib èaži obu-szoq’e-s goì ìeno uži=n hes
 that.OBL Habib Gadzhi father-GEN 1 be-RES be five son=and one
 ked=no
 daughter=and
 ‘Father Habib Gadzhi had five sons and one daughter.’ (N)
Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.

 hago Ø-Ü ežinnu obu Maèama èaži

 ‘(They) threw him out and offended my grandfather Mahama Gadzhi.’
 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.
(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:
I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father(I) Mohamed Gadzhi.ERG

down.’ (N)

I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).
(1270) ahlu sedi.sed-qo b-ihi:-š
 people REC . OBL - AT HPL-fight-PST
 ‘The people fought against each other.’
The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.
(1271) a. hagze-zsedi.hes b-ike-s

b. haze-qo k’ w ezi r-iqqogom [sedi.hes zok’-a]
 they.OBL - AT be.able V-happen.ICVB be.NEG REC beat-INF
 ‘They cannot beat each other.’
The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

29.2.7.2. Dislocated auxiliaries as topicalizing devices
The expression preceded by the dislocated auxiliary is not necessarily newly in-
troduced and thus in focus. More often it is a highly topical referent that had
been introduced into the discourse in the immediately preceding clause or it was
already the topic of a number of clauses in the preceding discourse. It can also
be a contrastive topic. In other words, dislocated auxiliaries often follow clause-
initially occurring topics, which can of course be contrastive (1427a), or just
simple topics (1427b, 1427c). In all following examples dislocated auxiliaries
occur right after typical presentational sentences used for the beginning of sto-
ries.

 that.OBL village-IN be one khan he=andbe V-ache.ICVB
 ‘In that village there is a khan, and he is ill.’ (N)
 But dislocated auxiliaries do not only highlight newly introduced topics.
Other topics such as first and second person pronouns (1428b) or contrastive
topics (1428c) are also marked with this construction. Note that usually in this
construction the linear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is reversed, i.e. the
auxiliary is located somewhere before the lexical verb. Only in (1428b) the lin-
ear order of auxiliary and lexical verb is the usual one (that is, the lexical verb
precedes the auxiliary), but both verbs are interrupted.

29.2.8. Sentence-focus structure (thetic sentences)
Thetic utterances are simple assertions: the entire situation is asserted as a whole
without distinguishing an argument or a predicate. They are contextually rela-
tively independent and can be felicitously uttered out of the blue. Lambrecht
(1994) takes as definitional criterion the non-topic marking of the subject. The
focus extends over both the subject and the predicate (minus any topical non-
subject elements). The following two subsections present different kinds of thetic
sentences.
29.2.8.1. Event-reporting and impersonal sentences
These sentences display the standard word order of intransitive sentences. There
are no dummy subjects. The accent falls on the verb. Therefore, there is no struc-
tural difference between intransitive thetic and topic-comment sentences: they
have the same word roder and the same intonation.
(1429) a. [What did you find out when you came to town yesterday?]
 [xan Ø-uhe-n]FOC
 khan(I) I-die-UWPST
 ‘The king died.’
 b. [Looking out of the window, seeing that the ground is wet.]
 [qema r-aq’e-n]FOC
 rain(V) V-come-UWPST
 ‘It rained.’
29.2.8.2. Presentational and existential sentences
Presentational and existential sentences introduce a (brand-new) animate refer-
ent into a discourse and make it available for subsequent predication (1430a,
The information structure of interrogative clauses 767
1430b). Presentational sentences make use of indefinite or definite accented lex-
ical noun phrases and a limited set of predicates. The predicates are mostly in-
transitive (e.g. ‘be’, ‘come’, ‘go by’, ‘live’, ‘arrive’, ‘appear’) and occasionally
experiencer verbs (e.g. ‘meet’, ‘see’).
(1430) a. hayìo-de-r[Ø-aq’-o Ø-eg w ey xexbe]FOC
 he.OBL - ALOC - LAT I-come-PRS I-small child(I)
 ‘A small child is coming to him.’ (S)
 b. hezzo=gozon [b-oňňo huni kezi.b.iq-no boc’e]FOC
 back=TOP III-in.the.middle way.IN meet.III-UWPST wolf(III)
 ‘Then in the middle of the way (they) met a wolf.’ (N)
A common subtype of presentational sentences are existential sentences that
assert the existence of some referent and have the copula as the only predicate.
The following two clauses illustrate existential clauses as they are typically used
in narrations.
(1431) a. [hes zoq’e-n rek’ w e]FOC
 one be-UWPST man
 ‘There was a man.’ (S)
 b. [zeq’ w e-n=eň zeq’ w e-n gom=eň hes miskinaw Ø-Ü eži
 be-UWPST = NARR be-UWPST be.NEG = NARR one poor I -old
w FOC
 očordiyu rek’ e]
 oldman(I)
 ‘Once there was an old, old poor man.’ (N)
In all sentences of the presentational type, including existential sentences, the
new referent follows the verb (e.g. VS word order for intransitive presentational
predicates). Locative and other adjuncts may precede or follow the verb. The
numeral ‘one’ is often used to mark thematically important referents.
29.3. The information structure of interrogative clauses
Not all interrogative clauses have a peculiar marking. Those interrogative clauses
that are headed by a verb form with past time reference and the evidentiality
value ‘neutral’ must be marked with a special suffix (-i, -y, -(y)e, and -iye) at-
tached to the stem of the predicate instead of the usual Simple Past suffix -s
(1433a, 1433c). All other interrogative clauses may but do not have to have the
Interrogative enclitic on the verb. Very rarely the Interrogative enclitic appears
on another constituent which is not the verb (cf. 29.3.2)
768Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.1. WH-questions
The position of the WH-word in WH-questions depends on its semantic role. If
the agent in a transitive clause or the subject of an intransitive clause is ques-
tioned, then the WH-word normally occurs clause-initially (1432a, 1432b).
(1432)a. “ìu b-Ü eži-yo?”=ňeneňi-n
who HPL-win-PRS = QUOT say-CVB
‘Who wins?’ (N)
 b. ìu-y hibadu išib-aq’er-iš goì hibaìu ked-ez?
who-ERG this apple(III) III-bring-RES be this.OBL girl-DAT
‘Who has brought the apple to the girl?’ (N)
For all other semantic roles, the preverbal position, which seems to be a
preferred focus position, is favored (1433a, 1433b, 1433c).
(1433)a. di-žoobu-yse ìono eňa suPal debez

 c. “haw=gon ìine-z b-iq’e-y?”=ňen eňi-n
that=TOP what.OBL - DAT III-bring-Q = QUOT say-CVB
‘As for that, why did (you) bring it?’ (N)
But WH-words occur also in sentence-initial position (1434a), especially
when they do not refer to S or A and have scope over the whole clause (1434b).
(1434)a. se mežiqu G w ede-r r-u:-ho?
what you.SG . ERG today day-LAT V-do-PRS
‘What do you do today the whole day long?’ (N)
 b. sira me k’aly-uxxogom?
why you.SG . ERG fasting(IV) IV -keep.ICVB be.NEG
‘Why do you not fast?’ (N)
Very occasionally a WH-word is found in the middle of its clause as in
(1435a) where the agent is topicalized. Testelec (1998b) reports for two other
Daghestanian languages, Archi and Tabasaran, that those orders in transitive
The information structure of interrogative clauses 769
WH-questions where the WH-phrase immediately follows the verb are ungram-
matical. In fact, in my Hinuq corpus there is no example at all where the verb
precedes the WH-phrase and informants reject elicited examples as ungrammat-
ical. Only in copula constructions lacking an overt verbal predicate does the
WH-word occur in clause-final position (1435b).
(1435) a. “me sira biša r-u:-y-me?”=ňen eňi-n
 you.SG . ERG why food( V) V-do-Q - NEG = QUOT say-UWPST
 xoddo-y
 husband-ERG
 ‘“As for you, why did you not prepare the food?” said the husband.’
 (N)
 b. hag čurGan ìi?
 that headscarf whose
 ‘That headscarf, whose is it?’ (N)
In elliptical WH-questions where the focus is only on the WH-word because
there is no other constituent, and in other WH-questions where only the WH-
word is in focus, the Interrogative enclitic may appear on the WH-word (1436).
(1436) ìu=ye?
who=Q
‘WHO?’ (N)
The position of the WH-word may influence the interpretations of the inter-
rogative clause. For example, in (1437a) the WH word appears clause-initially
and the spatial adjunct clause-finally. This question is preferred when standing
in front of a group of children, i.e. the scope of the WH-word is restricted to
a specific group of people. In contrast, in (1437b) the question is neutral in the
sense that its scope is open to everyone, present or not present at the moment
of speech, but the spatial adjunct iškola:r is topicalized. In principle, both ques-
tions can be used in the same range of situation, but (1437b) is more frequent
than (1437a).
(1437) a. ìu Ø-iň’i-me iškola:-r?
 who I-go-NEG school.IN - LAT
 ‘Who (from you) did not go to school?’
 b. [iškola:-r]TOP ìu Ø-iň’i-me?
 school.IN - LAT who I-go-NEG
 ‘Who did not go to school?’
770Chapter 29. Information structure
29.3.2. Polar questions
In WH-questions the WH-phrase is in focus. In polar questions the focus may be
indicated by the position of the Interrogative marker and is very often the verb
(1438a, 1438d). However, any other constituent besides the verb can also be in
focus, not only in main clauses (1438b), but also in subordinate clauses (1438c).
It is possible to have an Interrogative suffix and an Interrogative enclitic in one
clause if the verb is in the Simple Past (1438d) because verbs in the Simple Past
that appear in interrogative clauses are obligatorily marked with the Interrogative
suffix.

29.3.3. Argument focus in question-answer pairs
In identificational sentences the focus identifies the missing element in a presup-
posed open proposition. The phrase expressing the focus denotatum is the only
accented constituent in the sentence. Argument-focus is most easily identified in
question-answer pairs.
",tensor([31.5446]),"726 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.

26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).

Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).

Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.

In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.

‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).

‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo

‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).

The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.

If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).

 ‘Omar’si dog frightened himi/ j .’
When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).

For Tsez, Polinsky and Potsdam (2002) show that backward control repre-
sents a biclausal construction and not a monoclausal clause union construction.
In Hinuq not all of their arguments are applicable. Besides case assignment and
agreement, at least word order can be interpreted as pointing to a biclausal con-
struction. In (1182), which represents backward control, it is impossible for an
argument of the embedded clause to occur before the matrix verb in clause-initial
position.

 Mahama(I)-ERG yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
(Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.)
In contrast, (1183) represents the ordinary word order because the most
prominent argument is part of the matrix clause and precedes the matrix clause
verb.
(1183) Maèama huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I) yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
‘Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.’
That the matrix clause contains a covert agreement trigger can only be proven
by the agreement on the matrix verb. Apart form Hinuq and Tsez, backward
control exists in a few other Daghestanian languages like Tsez, Rutul (Kibrik
2003: 533), and Tsakhur (Kibrik 2003: 547), (Ljutikova & Bonč-Osmolovskaja
1999: 532); in these languages usually the phasal verb ‘begin, start’ and/or the
modal verb ‘must’ appear in this construction. Other languages outside of Dagh-
estan that exhibit backward control are Japanese, Brazilian Portugese, Korean,
and Kabardian (Polinsky & Potsdam 2006).
22.5. Summary of agreement and case assignment in complements
When looking at the patterns of agreement and case assignment in complement
clauses, there seem to be five possibilities (Table 84). The most prominent argu-
ment of the matrix clause can either have its case assigned by the matrix verb
Complement-taking adjectives, adverbs, and nouns649
itself or by the subordinate verb. However, as the example of k’ w ezi -iq- ‘be
able’ above shows (Section 22.4.6), the valency frame of the subordinate verb
can influence the case assignment of the matrix verb.

",67.24784088134766,"The biabsolutive construction can be interpreted as a means of decreasing
the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).

cede the main clause. Only the Purposive converb behaves exceptionally because
586 Chapter 21. Adverbial clauses
about half of the examples with this converb show the reverse order, with the con-
verbal clause following the main clause. But all types of converbal clauses may
be center embedded or follow the main clause without any change in meaning.
The following examples illustrate center embedding (1075a) with the conditional
converb and a converbal clause following the main clause (1075b) with the Ter-
minative converb.
(1075) a. eli [me elu-ì-edokezi.y.iq-o-me]
we.ERG you.SG we.OBL - CONT- DIR meet.II-COND - NEG
ň’u=nb-iG-agoì ň’ere-s
earth.roof(III)=and III-take-INF be upwards-ABL 1
‘If you are not on our side, we will take away the roof from above.’
(N)
b. “Üumar”=ňen eňi-yo, “žiqu=šid me t’ot’er-o, me
Umar=QUOT say-PRS today=on you.SG . ERG read-IMP you.SG
t’ot’er-o [debez r-et-ače]!”
learn-IMP you.SG . DAT V-want- TERM
‘“Umar,” he is saying, “from today on, you read, you study as long
as you want!”’ (lit. ‘until you want’) (N)
The relevant converbal clause need not be adjacent to the main clause. Other
converbal clauses which may (1076a) or may not (1076b) share arguments with
the other adverbial and main clauses can intervene.
(1076) a. me [hago Ø-ot’-nos] [hayìo-s b-ašir-no
you.SG . ERG heI -lay- ANT he. OBL - GEN 1 III-catch- CVB
q’oňu] [č’e-da-dokur-no]b-ek’ w er-o!=ňen
skin(III ) fire-OBL . IN - DIR throw-CVB III-burn-IMP = QUOT
‘After he goes to bed you take his skin, throw it into the fire, and
burn it!’ (N)
b. [idu-do Ø-aq’e-nos] essu-y[qema r-aq’-ono], qaca
home-DIR I-come-ANT brother(I) rain(V) V-come-CONC wood(V)
èadur r-u:-s
prepare V-do-PST
‘When he came home, the brother prepared wood even though it
rained.’
Extraction out of the adverbial clause is not allowed independently of the
place in which the extracted item is positioned. For instance, in (1077a) the pa-
tient of the converbal clause, mecxer ‘money’, has been moved into clause-initial
Word order and extraction587
position, and in (1077b) in clause-final position, both times leading to ungram-
maticality of the sentences. This is remarkable because another type of subordi-
nate clauses, namely complement clauses, are not so restricted since they allow
extraction of topicalized items.
(1077) a. * mecxeruži: k’oèlo b-ux-iš[b-aši-nos]
money( III) boy.ERG ball(III) III-buy-PST III-get-ANT
 (After the boy got the money, he bought a ball.)
b. * uži: [b-aši-yň’o] sayGat b-ux-išmecxer
 boy.ERG III-get-SIM present(III) III-buy-PST money(III)
 (When the boy got the money, he bought a present.)
In the converb clause, the converb is usually but not necessarily in clause-
final position. Examples like (1078), where the converb is followed by some
item of its clause, are quite easy to find in texts or to elicit. This distinguishes
adverbial clauses from relative clauses, which have a strict verb-final word order
(Section 20.2.2.1).
(1078) [idu-rØ-aq’e-yň’o yoňu.koka] boìiň’o b-iň’i-yogoìa

 brother.PL meat(V)=and V-ring-CVB HPL-come-UWPST
 ‘When Cinderello came home, his brothers who were gone hunting came
 home bringing meat.’ (N)
Subordinate structures are not subject to the Coordinate Structure Constraint
(Ross 1967). For Hinuq adverbial clauses, this means that relativization on a
constituent of the converbal clause should be allowed. In fact, this prediction is
borne out, at least for the Simple Anterior converb (1079a, 1079b), and also for
the Narrative converb (1079c, 1079d). However, the Realis Conditional and the
Concessive converb, which clearly represent subordinate clauses, do not allow
for relativization on their constituents (see the ungrammatical examples (1025d)
and (1025b) in Section 20.2.1.1.

21.5. The syntactic nature of adverbial clauses
A number of scholars have posed the question as to whether adverbial clauses
are syntactically coordinate, subordinate, cosubordinate, or something else (cf.
Haspelmath (1995b), Foley & van Valin (1984), Bickel (2010a) for the gen-
eral discussion and Good (2003) on Chechen, Creissels (2010c) on Akhvakh,
Polinsky (2007) on Tsez, Kazenin (2001a) on Bagvalal for analyses of Nakh-
Daghestanian languages). I will discuss this question briefly.
"," HPL -go-ICVB be.PTCP
 ‘while the two armies went in order to fight against each other ...’
 (N)
c. balon-be=nsedi.sed-eì hezzo b-uxxo zoq’ w e-s
 balloon-PL=and REC . OBL - CONT after III-buy.ICVB be-PST
 nawuti
 petroleum(III)
 ‘One after the other bought petroleum bottles.’ (N)
The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).
(1270) ahlu sedi.sed-qo b-ihi:-š
 people REC . OBL - AT HPL-fight-PST
 ‘The people fought against each other.’
The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.
(1271) a. hagze-zsedi.hes b-ike-s
 they.OBL - DAT RECHPL-see- PST
 ‘They saw each other.’
b. haze-qo k’ w ezi r-iqqogom [sedi.hes zok’-a]
 they.OBL - AT be.able V-happen.ICVB be.NEG REC beat-INF
 ‘They cannot beat each other.’
The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

If the embedded verb is intransitive, then it is impossible to say whether the
construction represents forward or backward control.

 ‘The drummer began to shout.’ (N)
For Tsez, Polinsky and Potsdam (2002) show that backward control repre-
sents a biclausal construction and not a monoclausal clause union construction.
In Hinuq not all of their arguments are applicable. Besides case assignment and
agreement, at least word order can be interpreted as pointing to a biclausal con-
struction. In (1182), which represents backward control, it is impossible for an
argument of the embedded clause to occur before the matrix verb in clause-initial
position.
(1182) * Maèama-y huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I)-ERG yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
(Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.)
In contrast, (1183) represents the ordinary word order because the most
prominent argument is part of the matrix clause and precedes the matrix clause
verb.
(1183) Maèama huìØ-uìi-š [buňe b-uw-a]
 Mahama(I) yesterday I-begin- PST house(III) III-make-INF
‘Yesterday Mahama began to build a house.’
That the matrix clause contains a covert agreement trigger can only be proven
by the agreement on the matrix verb. Apart form Hinuq and Tsez, backward
control exists in a few other Daghestanian languages like Tsez, Rutul (Kibrik
2003: 533), and Tsakhur (Kibrik 2003: 547), (Ljutikova & Bonč-Osmolovskaja
1999: 532); in these languages usually the phasal verb ‘begin, start’ and/or the
modal verb ‘must’ appear in this construction. Other languages outside of Dagh-
estan that exhibit backward control are Japanese, Brazilian Portugese, Korean,
and Kabardian (Polinsky & Potsdam 2006).
22.5. Summary of agreement and case assignment in complements
When looking at the patterns of agreement and case assignment in complement
clauses, there seem to be five possibilities (Table 84). The most prominent argu-
ment of the matrix clause can either have its case assigned by the matrix verb
Complement-taking adjectives, adverbs, and nouns649
itself or by the subordinate verb. However, as the example of k’ w ezi -iq- ‘be
able’ above shows (Section 22.4.6), the valency frame of the subordinate verb
can influence the case assignment of the matrix verb.

 As in all clause types of Hinuq, the word order in complement clauses is
predominantly but not strictly head-final. Examples with head-final word order
can be found throughout this chapter. (1080) illustrates a complement clause
where the verb in the complement clause does not appear in the last position.

 In Tables 81–83 the most important complement-taking verbs and construc-
tions and their strategies are subsumed. The column ‘case’ gives the case mark-
ing of the most prominent argument of these verbs. The abbreviations used are
LA=local agreement, LDA=long distance agreement and BC=backward control.
",tensor([30.2961]),"The biabsolutive construction can be interpreted as a means of decreasing
the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.

 The ambiguity is more pragmatic than syntactic in nature. That is, if the two
nouns cannot both be interpreted as substitutes then no ambiguity arises. In other
words, it is not the syntactic structure alone that can lead to ambiguities. For
instance, (1342a) and (1342b) have the same syntactic structure as (1340), but
only one meaning since in (1342a) the two nouns t’ek ‘book’ and žurnal ‘journal’
can only functions as objects of the verb t’ot’er- ‘read’, and in (1342b) essu
‘sibling’ can only be interpreted as substituting the agent but never the patient of
the same verb ‘read’.

26.4. Appositional phrases
Appositional phrases consist of two (or more) noun phrases with the same refer-
ence, and the noun phrases immediately follow each other. As indicated by mod-
ifiers and case marking, appositional phrases behave like a single noun phrase
in their clause (see below for the relevant examples). They typically involve a
proper name plus a kinship term (1343a) or a profession or another characteriz-
ing term plus a ‘dummy noun’ rek’ w e ‘man’ or aqili ‘woman’ (1343b, 1343c).
Occasionally a name plus a profession (1348a) or a toponymic expression occur
(1350a). The typical order is name plus kinship term/profession/toponym and
profession plus ‘dummy noun’.

 Appositional phrases 727
Case is only on the second noun phrase marked (1344a, 1344b). The apposi-
tion always remains in the Absolutive (1344a, 1344b).
(1344)a. q’orol aqila-y xan-eskedsweru

house.OBL - ILOC - LAT V-half at.night HPL -go-PRS they
‘At midnight they go to that man – the shepherd’s house.’ (N)
Modifiers syntactically refer to the second noun phrase, e.g. demonstrative
pronouns appear in the oblique form, or possessive pronouns must have the Sec-
ond Genitive case if the second noun is in an oblique case (1345), (1347a).

 that.OBL Habib Gadzhi father-GEN 1 be-RES be five son=and one
 ked=no
 daughter=and
 ‘Father Habib Gadzhi had five sons and one daughter.’ (N)
Occasionally the typical order is reversed, i.e. the name can follow the kin-
ship term or the profession, especially if the appositional phrase is modified by
several modifiers because in this manner the modifiers that semantically belong
to the kinship term directly precede this term (1346). But usually the order is
fixed, e.g. to change the order of the profession and the dummy noun in a phrase
like (1343b) is ungrammatical.

 ‘(They) threw him out and offended my grandfather Mahama Gadzhi.’
 (N)
In any case, it is only the second noun, or, if two or more names appear in
a sequence, it is only the last name that can be case marked (1347a, 1347b). In
728 Chapter 26. Other minor constructions
other words, it is the order of the two nouns that is important, and none of the
nouns can be claimed to represent the head of the appositional phrase.
(1347)a. di-žoØ-Ü ežinnu obuMuèamad èaži:

I.OBL - GEN 2 I-old father Hapiz Umar-GEN 1 sister Pari=QUOT
eňi-ngoì
say-CVB be
‘My grandfather Hapiz Umar has a sister called Pari.’
The combination of a name plus a profession, which seems to be less fre-
quently used, is quite tolerant with both word orders. The second noun phrase,
be it the profession or the name, takes the case marking (1348a, 1348b).
(1348)a. Šamil exo-y G w e zok’-iš
Shamil herdsman-ERG dog beat-PST
‘The herdsman Shamil beat the dog.’
b. učitel Maèama-y maÜarul mec toňňo
teacher Mahama-ERG Avarlanguage give.PRS
‘The teacher Mahama teaches Avar.’
If, however, the apposition and its noun phrase are separated by a pause, they
do not form a single phrase anymore. Only in this case is it possible to add case
suffixes to both noun phrases:
(1349) di-žoessu-y, Maèama-y G w edes r-uxxoxu
 I.OBL - GEN 2 brother-ERG, Mahama-ERG daily V-buy.PRS meat(V)
 ‘My brother, Mahama, buys meat every day.’
For toponymic expressions preceded by a proper name, the same rules apply
as for the appositional phrases described above. The name precedes the com-
mon noun. The reverse order is ungrammatical. Only the common noun takes
case markers. With other nouns, which are not toponymic expressions, Genitive
phrases are used, e.g Hinuzas mec ‘Hinuq language’ (see Chapter 14 for more
details on place names, language names, ethnic names, etc.).

in other Tsezic languages (cf. Kibrik & Kodzasov (1990), Maddieson et al.

historical development of pharyngealization remains a subject of debate. Lom-
tadze (1963: 23) claims that pharyngealization developed under the influence of
the neighboring language Tsez. Imnajšvili (1963: 19) states that pharyngealiza-
tion and the pharyngeal fricative /Ü/ developed from the glottal stop. Isakov and
Khalilov (2004: 173, 2005: 567) argue that pharyngealization is a feature of the
vowels /a/ and /e/.

affricates are voiceless nonejective and voiceless ejective. In every box the first

"," Just as verbs in other clause types, the copula most frequently occurs in
clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì

‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’
b. hadu ked c’aq’=tow bercinaw zeq’ w e-n

c. Üumru=n b-egiy zoq’e-s elu-shayteì

 ‘And our life there was good.’ (N)
Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).

18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.

Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).

 ‘That the girl read the book is good.’
18.3.2. The predicate is in an oblique case
The predicate noun phrase can take various case markers according to its func-
tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).

When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).
(963) a. debek w ezey-be mesed-li-š goì

18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).

18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì

 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.

",65.5399398803711," A strong correlation between the initial segment of a noun and the appropri-
ate agreement prefix has already been proposed for several other Nakh-Daghesta-
nian languages (e.g. see Kibrik (1977: 64–66) for Archi, Nichols (1989) for Nakh
and Comrie & Polinsky (1999b) for Tsez and Hunzib). Comrie and Polinsky ex-
tend this proposal also to stem final segments. In order to establish such corre-
lations an analysis of the nominal lexicon is first necessary. Both directions of
the correlation, from classes to initial/final segments and vice versa have been
examined. After counting all 800 nouns in my material the results are given in
Tables 17-20. In these tables the abbreviation seg. refers to the segments and occ.
(‘occurence’) to the number of nouns beginning with that segment.

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).

The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

alternatively in a newer version of these books by Kibrik (2003), and partially

Participles are functionally similar to adjectives. Hinuq has five participles
of which the Resultative participle especially, but also the Habitual participle are
used in copula clauses. They can basically have the same predicative function as
an ordinary adjective. In fact, a few verbs with the Resultative participle suffix
are listed as adjectives in the dictionary, e.g. -exň’es ‘warm’. For more informa-
tion on participles see Section 7.7.4. If the participle can agree, it agrees with the
copula subject (959).

18.3. Copula clauses with nominal predicates
18.3.1. The predicate is in the Absolutive
In identificational and classification sentences, both the subject and the pred-
icative argument are in the Absolutive case. It is not always easy to say which
Absolutive noun phrase is the subject and which is the predicative argument be-
cause the word order is variable. The subject and the predicate can be proper
names, common nouns, noun phrases, or pronouns.

Noun phrases may be specific or general descriptions. These are clauses
headed by an Infinitive, a Purposive converb (961a) or by a verb marked with
the Abstract suffix, as is common in certain complement clauses (961b).

 ‘That the girl read the book is good.’
18.3.2. The predicate is in an oblique case
The predicate noun phrase can take various case markers according to its func-
tion. In order to express benefaction, it must be in the Dative (962a, 962b).
(962) a. hibadi goìa beňe-s žo=n debez

 ‘If (you) stop not giving (it to me), shame on you.’ (N)
When expressing quality or material, the noun phrase must be in the Genitive
(963a). The origin is expressed by a spatial case containing the Ablative (963b).
Noun phrases denoting spatial goals are marked with a spatial case containing
the Lative (963c).
(963) a. debek w ezey-be mesed-li-š goì

c. had kaGat Pat’imat-ň’o-r goì

18.4. Existential copula clauses
Existential clauses contain only one noun phrase. In existential clauses used as
introductory sentences for fairy tales, the noun phrase is usually split up into the
numeral hes ‘one’ preceding the copula and the rest of the noun phrase (noun
plus modifiers) following the copula (964b).

 ‘There was one poor man.’ (N)
18.5. Locative copula clauses
Locative copula clauses and existential copula clauses containing a locative ad-
junct cannot be distinguished. Clauses where the location precedes the subject
are often ambiguous between an existential and a locative reading (965a, 965b).
(965) a. sedaGobeňe aq’ w e goì

 ‘In Chechnya there were all white houses.’ (N)
If the order is reversed, and the item denoting the location follows the subject,
the interpretation is usually only locative. However, the interpretation depends
also on the subject type. For example, in (966a) an existential interpretation,
though possible, seems very unlikely.
",68.91824340820312," Just as verbs in other clause types, the copula most frequently occurs in
clause-final position, but other orders are also possible. The copula subject is
always in the Absolutive case. It may be a noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a
numeral, or any other type of noun phrase. The copula complement may be a
noun, a proper name, a pronoun, a numeral, or another type of noun phrase, but
it may also be an adjective, a postpositional phrase, or a participle. It may be in
the Absolutive case or in an oblique case (including spatial cases).
18.2. Copula clauses with adjectival and participial predicates
Hinuq adjectives can be used both attributively and predicatively. Since their
form is the same in both cases and the head noun is optional, a sentence like
(958a) can always be interpreted as containing a nominalized adjective as the
predicate. Then the translation must be ‘The house is a big one’. Adjectives with
agreement prefixes agree with the subject noun phrase in gender and number
(958a, 958c). The adjective, with or without modifying adverbs, usually follows
the subject and precedes the verb, but other orders are possible. However, if
the adjective directly precedes the nominal subject, then the sentence can be
interpreted as an existential construction.
(958) a. buňe b-ežiy goì
house(III) III-big be
‘The house is big.’ or ‘The house is a big one.’

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).
(1300) a. diessu dew-zo essu-de-r bercinaw goì

 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).

 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140

 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.

predominantly but not strictly head-final. Examples with head-final word order

In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).

 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).

 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140

 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of
comparative constructions, not only for the expression of age differences.
",68.67547607421875," There is a simple explanation as to why the AT-Essive and not another case
is used to mark non-canonical agents in causative constructions; this explanation
makes use of the hierarchy of syntactic positions: Comrie (1976b) notes that
in the paradigm case of causatives derived from transitive verbs, the causee is
likely to take the same case marking as indirect objects in ditransitive clauses.
Embedded subjects (e.g. causees) are demoted stepwise down the case hierarchy
(subject, direct object, indirect object, other obliques). Transitive verbs already
have a subject and a direct object, thus the newly added argument takes the role of
the indirect object. In Hinuq, indirect objects of ditransitive verbs like ‘give’ are
marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.

The number of loans from Russian is constantly growing since nowadays all new
loans, including all internationalisms are borrowed from Russian. An illustrative
list is given in (5). The influence from Russian is especially obvious in trans-
lations from Russian into Hinuq, which not only contain more Russian words
than natural discourse, but also show alternations in the syntax. For instance, the
word order in Russian is predominantly agent-verb-patient, but in Hinuq it is
agent-patient-verb. Another example is the use of nouns marked for plural after
all numbers except for the numeral 1, which is the norm in Russian, but not in
Hinuq (in Hinuq normally the singular is used).

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.

Reflexivization 671
 ‘His∗i/ j dog frightened Omari .’
If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).
(1223) a. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago∗i/ j Ø-uň’er-iš

b. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago=towi/ j Ø-uň’er-iš
 Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG he=SELF I -frighten- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog frightened himi/ j .’
When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):
(1224) Üumar-esi G w e j zoni.zon-ň’o-r∗i/ j b-eze-s
 Omar-GEN 1 dog(III) RED . REFL . SG . OBL - SPR - LAT III-look- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog j looked at itself∗i/ j .’
When the simple reflexive pronoun is marked with =tow, then the possessor
functions as antecedent (1225). The enclitic cannot be left out because then the
sentence becomes incomprehensible (1216a).
(1225) Üumar-zoi G w e-y j zo=towi/∗ jhil-iš
 Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG REFL . SG = SELF bite-PST
 ‘Omar’si dog j bit himi/∗ j .’
24.1.2.4. Word order and reversal of roles
The word order of reflexive pronouns is in principle free, i.e. they usually follow
their antecedent, but the reversed order is also possible.

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).

The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-

spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).

(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance
Spatial postpositions387
‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.

If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).

When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).
(1227) a.",68.47392272949219," To conclude, Bickel (2010a) proposes the decomposition of terms referring
to clause linkage (e.g. ‘subordination’, ‘cosubordination’, etc.) into sets of vari-
ables with possible values in order to capture the variation between construc-
tions. Afterwards it is possible to measure the diversity between constructions
from many languages. In fact, these variables represent a useful tool for analyz-
ing adverbial clauses and have at least partially been considered in this chapter.

24.1.2.2. Status of the reflexive
The reflexive can be a core argument. In this case it functions as the direct object
of a transitive verb (1217a), or as the stimulus of an experiencer verb (1217b).
Note that simple reflexive pronouns normally do not appear in core argument
positions of local reflexive constructions in my corpus. Such examples can be
elicited, but monotransitive sentences with a simple reflexive pronoun in the P
position are quite marginal (1217c). At least in the experiencer construction the
order of controller and controllee can be reversed (1217d).
"," Due to the scarcity of examples, the exact meaning of this suffix remains
unclear. But it seems to be comparable to the animate location suffix because
example (162b) has about the same meaning as example (154c) where the -Go has
been replaced by the ALOC ending -de. Furthermore, two other Tsezic languages,
Khwarshi and Bezhta, have local case suffixes that are cognates and could also be
related to the Hinuq -Go. In Khwarshi this suffix is -Go and it expresses location
near some reference point (Khalilova 2009: 82). In Bezhta the suffix is -Ga and
means ‘next to and touching’ (Kibrik & Testelec 2004: 236).

3.5.31. bito
The adverb bito ‘there’ seems to be on its way to becoming an orientation marker.
It is used as an adverb with the meaning ‘there, away’ and occurs also in three
complex adverbs (Section 10.2.1.7). In its adverbial use bito is phonologically
unbound, as Hinuq adverbs typically are. It is possible to derive two verbs from
bito, the intransitive verb bitoì- ‘move aside’ and the transitive verb bitok’-
‘move aside’, which is also typical for spatial adverbs. But bito does not take
the full range of spatial case suffixes. There is only the lexicalized variant bitoho
‘there, away’. The adverb has a few properties that make it more spatial-case like.
Despite its ability to occur on its own when it expresses the meaning ‘there’, in
104 Chapter 3. Nouns
most contexts bito means ‘through, after’ and it does not form a phonological
word on its own but is added to the preceding word, which can be a noun, pro-
noun, or a spatial or temporal adverb. The nouns and pronouns to which bito is
added must already have a spatial case suffix, more precisely a location marker.
Bito is used with spatial (163a), temporal (163b), and even metaphorical (163b)
meaning. It shares all these latter properties with other spatial cases, in particu-
lar with the orientation markers Essive, Ablative, Lative, and Directional. In fact,
the grammar by Khalilov & Isakov (2005: 575), following Vakilov (1998), lists
bito as belonging to the orientation markers.

The non-local uses are not equally distributed among the local cases. The AT
suffix used without any additional orientation marker is clearly the suffix which
has the most non-local uses. It is used in order to mark arguments of various
kinds of verbs (communication, perception, experiencer and ditransitive verbs,
causative and potential verb forms) and possessors in predicative possession
clauses. Hence, a connection between the grammatical roles of experiencer, ad-
dressee, recipient, possessor, and spatial meanings seems to exist. This connec-
tion is natural from a conceptual point of view (recipients possess the object they
receive, addressees of verbs of speech receive information) and has been shown
in typological studies (cf. Haspelmath (1999a), Ganenkov (2006), Rice & Ka-
bata (2007)). The extended range of grammatical functions of AT correlates with
the fact that this suffix rarely indicates spatial location and movement.

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).
",65.29013061523438," There is a simple explanation as to why the AT-Essive and not another case
is used to mark non-canonical agents in causative constructions; this explanation
makes use of the hierarchy of syntactic positions: Comrie (1976b) notes that
in the paradigm case of causatives derived from transitive verbs, the causee is
likely to take the same case marking as indirect objects in ditransitive clauses.
Embedded subjects (e.g. causees) are demoted stepwise down the case hierarchy
(subject, direct object, indirect object, other obliques). Transitive verbs already
have a subject and a direct object, thus the newly added argument takes the role of
the indirect object. In Hinuq, indirect objects of ditransitive verbs like ‘give’ are
marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.

If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).

When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-

11.2.8. aldoGo ‘in front of’
The postposition aldoGo can be used with three cases leading always to the spa-
tial meaning ‘in front of’, namely the CONT-Essive (682a), the ALOC-Essive
(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

11.2.9. dandi ‘towards, against’
This postposition, an Avar loan word, governs the ILOC-Essive with inanimate
nouns (683a) and the ALOC-Essive with animate nouns (683b, 683c). It can have
a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance
Spatial postpositions387
‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.
","The biabsolutive construction can be interpreted as a means of decreasing
the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number
Biabsolutive constructions529
of languages that have differential subject marking: the lower in prominence the
subject, the more frequently it is case marked.

24.1.2.2. Status of the reflexive
The reflexive can be a core argument. In this case it functions as the direct object
of a transitive verb (1217a), or as the stimulus of an experiencer verb (1217b).
Note that simple reflexive pronouns normally do not appear in core argument
positions of local reflexive constructions in my corpus. Such examples can be
elicited, but monotransitive sentences with a simple reflexive pronoun in the P
position are quite marginal (1217c). At least in the experiencer construction the
order of controller and controllee can be reversed (1217d).

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.

If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).

When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).
",tensor([30.6629]),"The biabsolutive construction can be interpreted as a means of decreasing
the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-

",67.24860382080078," Due to the scarcity of examples, the exact meaning of this suffix remains
unclear. But it seems to be comparable to the animate location suffix because
example (162b) has about the same meaning as example (154c) where the -Go has
been replaced by the ALOC ending -de. Furthermore, two other Tsezic languages,
Khwarshi and Bezhta, have local case suffixes that are cognates and could also be
related to the Hinuq -Go. In Khwarshi this suffix is -Go and it expresses location
near some reference point (Khalilova 2009: 82). In Bezhta the suffix is -Ga and
means ‘next to and touching’ (Kibrik & Testelec 2004: 236).

3.5.31. bito
The adverb bito ‘there’ seems to be on its way to becoming an orientation marker.
It is used as an adverb with the meaning ‘there, away’ and occurs also in three
complex adverbs (Section 10.2.1.7). In its adverbial use bito is phonologically
unbound, as Hinuq adverbs typically are. It is possible to derive two verbs from
bito, the intransitive verb bitoì- ‘move aside’ and the transitive verb bitok’-
‘move aside’, which is also typical for spatial adverbs. But bito does not take
the full range of spatial case suffixes. There is only the lexicalized variant bitoho
‘there, away’. The adverb has a few properties that make it more spatial-case like.
Despite its ability to occur on its own when it expresses the meaning ‘there’, in
104 Chapter 3. Nouns
most contexts bito means ‘through, after’ and it does not form a phonological
word on its own but is added to the preceding word, which can be a noun, pro-
noun, or a spatial or temporal adverb. The nouns and pronouns to which bito is
added must already have a spatial case suffix, more precisely a location marker.
Bito is used with spatial (163a), temporal (163b), and even metaphorical (163b)
meaning. It shares all these latter properties with other spatial cases, in particu-
lar with the orientation markers Essive, Ablative, Lative, and Directional. In fact,
the grammar by Khalilov & Isakov (2005: 575), following Vakilov (1998), lists
bito as belonging to the orientation markers.

3.5.32. Non-spatial functions of the spatial cases
The non-local uses are not equally distributed among the local cases. The AT
suffix used without any additional orientation marker is clearly the suffix which
has the most non-local uses. It is used in order to mark arguments of various
kinds of verbs (communication, perception, experiencer and ditransitive verbs,
causative and potential verb forms) and possessors in predicative possession
clauses. Hence, a connection between the grammatical roles of experiencer, ad-
dressee, recipient, possessor, and spatial meanings seems to exist. This connec-
tion is natural from a conceptual point of view (recipients possess the object they
receive, addressees of verbs of speech receive information) and has been shown
in typological studies (cf. Haspelmath (1999a), Ganenkov (2006), Rice & Ka-
bata (2007)). The extended range of grammatical functions of AT correlates with
the fact that this suffix rarely indicates spatial location and movement.
",67.64903259277344," Due to the scarcity of examples, the exact meaning of this suffix remains
unclear. But it seems to be comparable to the animate location suffix because

3.5.31. bito
The adverb bito ‘there’ seems to be on its way to becoming an orientation marker.
It is used as an adverb with the meaning ‘there, away’ and occurs also in three
complex adverbs (Section 10.2.1.7). In its adverbial use bito is phonologically
unbound, as Hinuq adverbs typically are. It is possible to derive two verbs from
bito, the intransitive verb bitoì- ‘move aside’ and the transitive verb bitok’-
‘move aside’, which is also typical for spatial adverbs. But bito does not take
the full range of spatial case suffixes. There is only the lexicalized variant bitoho
‘there, away’. The adverb has a few properties that make it more spatial-case like.
Despite its ability to occur on its own when it expresses the meaning ‘there’, in
104 Chapter 3. Nouns
most contexts bito means ‘through, after’ and it does not form a phonological
word on its own but is added to the preceding word, which can be a noun, pro-
noun, or a spatial or temporal adverb. The nouns and pronouns to which bito is
added must already have a spatial case suffix, more precisely a location marker.
Bito is used with spatial (163a), temporal (163b), and even metaphorical (163b)
meaning. It shares all these latter properties with other spatial cases, in particu-
lar with the orientation markers Essive, Ablative, Lative, and Directional. In fact,
the grammar by Khalilov & Isakov (2005: 575), following Vakilov (1998), lists
bito as belonging to the orientation markers.

3.5.32. Non-spatial functions of the spatial cases
The non-local uses are not equally distributed among the local cases. The AT
suffix used without any additional orientation marker is clearly the suffix which
has the most non-local uses. It is used in order to mark arguments of various
kinds of verbs (communication, perception, experiencer and ditransitive verbs,
causative and potential verb forms) and possessors in predicative possession
clauses. Hence, a connection between the grammatical roles of experiencer, ad-
dressee, recipient, possessor, and spatial meanings seems to exist. This connec-
tion is natural from a conceptual point of view (recipients possess the object they
receive, addressees of verbs of speech receive information) and has been shown
in typological studies (cf. Haspelmath (1999a), Ganenkov (2006), Rice & Ka-
bata (2007)). The extended range of grammatical functions of AT correlates with
the fact that this suffix rarely indicates spatial location and movement.

24.1.2.3. Object control of possessors
If the possessor of the more prominent argument in a clause is coreferential with
the less prominent argument of the same clause, then the possessor must be a
reflexive pronoun. It cannot be a normal demonstrative pronoun. Usually, the
reflexive pronoun =tow is added in order to facilitate the interpretation.

Reflexivization 671
 ‘His∗i/ j dog frightened Omari .’
If the possessor is expressed as a noun phrase anteceding the pronoun in
the object position, then coreference is excluded if the object is a demonstrative
pronoun (1223a). If =tow is added to the demonstrative pronoun, then the pos-
sessor can be interpreted as the antecedent, but disjoint reference is also possible
(1223b).
(1223) a. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago∗i/ j Ø-uň’er-iš

b. Üumar-zoi G w e-y hago=towi/ j Ø-uň’er-iš
 Omar-GEN 2 dog-ERG he=SELF I -frighten- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog frightened himi/ j .’
When the reduplicated demonstrative pronoun is used in the same position,
then it must be interpreted as being coreferential with the more prominent argu-
ment (1224), not with the possessor (see also (1216c) above):
(1224) Üumar-esi G w e j zoni.zon-ň’o-r∗i/ j b-eze-s
 Omar-GEN 1 dog(III) RED . REFL . SG . OBL - SPR - LAT III-look- PST
 ‘Omar’si dog j looked at itself∗i/ j .’
When the simple reflexive pronoun is marked with =tow, then the possessor
functions as antecedent (1225). The enclitic cannot be left out because then the
sentence becomes incomprehensible (1216a).
(1225) Üumar-zoi G w e-y j zo=towi/∗ jhil-iš

 ‘Omar’si dog j bit himi/∗ j .’
24.1.2.4. Word order and reversal of roles
The word order of reflexive pronouns is in principle free, i.e. they usually follow
their antecedent, but the reversed order is also possible.

With simple reflexive pronouns, the roles of antecedent and pronoun cannot
be reversed. With reduplicated reflexive pronouns, it is likewise mostly impos-
sible to change the roles of controller and controllee such that the reflexive pro-
noun takes the more prominent role and the noun phrase the less prominent one.
Thus, in the extended intransitive construction, the controller must be in the Ab-
solutive case and the controllee is the reflexive pronoun (1227a); the other way
around is ungrammatical (1227b).

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).
",62.8852767944336," Due to the scarcity of examples, the exact meaning of this suffix remains
unclear. But it seems to be comparable to the animate location suffix because
example (162b) has about the same meaning as example (154c) where the -Go has
been replaced by the ALOC ending -de. Furthermore, two other Tsezic languages,
Khwarshi and Bezhta, have local case suffixes that are cognates and could also be
related to the Hinuq -Go. In Khwarshi this suffix is -Go and it expresses location
near some reference point (Khalilova 2009: 82). In Bezhta the suffix is -Ga and
means ‘next to and touching’ (Kibrik & Testelec 2004: 236).

",tensor([28.4160])," A strong correlation between the initial segment of a noun and the appropri-
ate agreement prefix has already been proposed for several other Nakh-Daghesta-
nian languages (e.g. see Kibrik (1977: 64–66) for Archi, Nichols (1989) for Nakh
and Comrie & Polinsky (1999b) for Tsez and Hunzib). Comrie and Polinsky ex-
tend this proposal also to stem final segments. In order to establish such corre-
lations an analysis of the nominal lexicon is first necessary. Both directions of
the correlation, from classes to initial/final segments and vice versa have been
examined. After counting all 800 nouns in my material the results are given in
Tables 17-20. In these tables the abbreviation seg. refers to the segments and occ.
(‘occurence’) to the number of nouns beginning with that segment.

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).
(974) a. zekìer-oč’č’u r-iči / r-ič-agoì
 tomorrow water( V) V-cold V-be / V-be- INF be
 ‘Tomorrow the water will be warm.’
b. neten de y-iči-yo q’ede!
 always I II-be-PRS IRR
 ‘May I (fem.) always be!’ (i.e. live forever)
Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).

 ‘When I (masc.) grow up I will become a hunter.’
If in ‘X becomes Y’ the Y is an adverb or adjective, the noun phrase denoting
the subject X is in the Absolutive case and triggers agreement:

b. hibay haw č’agu y-iq-iš goì, haw ked

 ‘There she becomes alive, that girl.’ (N)
Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.
(977) a. hayìu-qo y-ese q’ono qu=čeňebu

Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).

unclear. But it seems to be comparable to the animate location suffix because
example (162b) has about the same meaning as example (154c) where the -Go has
been replaced by the ALOC ending -de. Furthermore, two other Tsezic languages,
Khwarshi and Bezhta, have local case suffixes that are cognates and could also be
related to the Hinuq -Go. In Khwarshi this suffix is -Go and it expresses location
near some reference point (Khalilova 2009: 82). In Bezhta the suffix is -Ga and
means ‘next to and touching’ (Kibrik & Testelec 2004: 236).

3.5.31. bito
The adverb bito ‘there’ seems to be on its way to becoming an orientation marker.
It is used as an adverb with the meaning ‘there, away’ and occurs also in three
complex adverbs (Section 10.2.1.7). In its adverbial use bito is phonologically
unbound, as Hinuq adverbs typically are. It is possible to derive two verbs from
bito, the intransitive verb bitoì- ‘move aside’ and the transitive verb bitok’-
‘move aside’, which is also typical for spatial adverbs. But bito does not take
the full range of spatial case suffixes. There is only the lexicalized variant bitoho
‘there, away’. The adverb has a few properties that make it more spatial-case like.
Despite its ability to occur on its own when it expresses the meaning ‘there’, in
104 Chapter 3. Nouns
most contexts bito means ‘through, after’ and it does not form a phonological
word on its own but is added to the preceding word, which can be a noun, pro-
noun, or a spatial or temporal adverb. The nouns and pronouns to which bito is
added must already have a spatial case suffix, more precisely a location marker.
Bito is used with spatial (163a), temporal (163b), and even metaphorical (163b)
meaning. It shares all these latter properties with other spatial cases, in particu-
lar with the orientation markers Essive, Ablative, Lative, and Directional. In fact,
the grammar by Khalilov & Isakov (2005: 575), following Vakilov (1998), lists
bito as belonging to the orientation markers.

3.5.32. Non-spatial functions of the spatial cases
The non-local uses are not equally distributed among the local cases. The AT
suffix used without any additional orientation marker is clearly the suffix which
has the most non-local uses. It is used in order to mark arguments of various
kinds of verbs (communication, perception, experiencer and ditransitive verbs,
causative and potential verb forms) and possessors in predicative possession
clauses. Hence, a connection between the grammatical roles of experiencer, ad-
dressee, recipient, possessor, and spatial meanings seems to exist. This connec-
tion is natural from a conceptual point of view (recipients possess the object they
receive, addressees of verbs of speech receive information) and has been shown
in typological studies (cf. Haspelmath (1999a), Ganenkov (2006), Rice & Ka-
bata (2007)). The extended range of grammatical functions of AT correlates with
the fact that this suffix rarely indicates spatial location and movement.

17.10.3. Analyzing the biabsolutive construction
Diachronically the biabsolutive construction probably developed from a biclausal
construction consisting of an embedded clause headed by the lexical verb and a
main clause headed by what is now an auxiliary. Since this auxiliary is intransi-
tive, its subject argument must be in the Absolutive case. Several authors have
claimed for other Daghestanian languages that the respective biabsolutive con-
structions are biclausal (e.g. Kibrik (1979) for Archi, Kazenin (1998) for Lak,
Radžabov (1999) for Tsez and Creissels (2008) for Avar). Diachronic biclausal-
ity may be an explanation for the word order restrictions of the construction.
Likewise, diachronic biclausality may be an explanation as to why one infor-
mant noted that biabsolutive constructions provide adequate answers to where-
questions. Biabsolutive constructions are periphrastic and involve the verb ‘be’,
and periphrastic tense-aspect-mood forms have often arisen from original loca-
tive constructions (Bybee et al. 1994: 129ff.). A detailed analysis of the biab-
solutive construction in Nakh-Daghestanian languages can be found in Forker
(2012a).

(682b), and the ILOC-Essive (682c). It also occurs with the temporal meaning
‘ago, before’ (11.3.1). The postposition can be case-marked (682c) and functions
as an adverb (Section 10.2.2.5). There are two verbs derived from this postpo-
sition: aldoGoì- ‘move forward, advance’ (intr.) and aldoGok’- ‘move forward’
(tr.).

This postposition, an Avar loan word, governs the ILOC-Essive with inanimate
nouns (683a) and the ALOC-Essive with animate nouns (683b, 683c). It can have
a clear spatial meaning (683b), but more abstract interpretations, as for instance

‘against’, are also possible (683b). When employed as an adverbial, dandi has
both temporal and spatial meaning (Section 10.2.2.10). This postposition can
take case markers (683b) and serve as the base for two derived verbs: dandeì-
‘unite’ (intr.) and dandek’- ‘make near’ (tr.).

11.2.10.ň’ w oq’ar ‘in front of, towards’
This postposition is based on the noun ň’ w oq’o ‘forehead’ marked with the IN-
Lative case. Because it contains, at least diachronically, a case marker, ň’ w oq’ar
cannot take additional case markers. The postposition governs the ALOC-Essive
(684a), the ILOC-Essive (684b), or the Second Genitive case (684c). The use of
the Second Genitive case seems natural if one thinks of the postpositional phrase
as a phrase expressing possession. That is, ň’oq’ar hayìozo can also be translated
as ‘towards his forehead’, in which case the pronoun must be marked with the
second Genitive because the head noun carries already an oblique case suffix.
Maybe this explains why the order of adposition and noun is reversed in (684c).
Although the most frequent word order in Genitive phrases is Genitive-noun, the
reverse order is relatively common. In fact, the standard order in genitive phrases,
genitive-noun, would also be possible in (684c). In contrast, in postpositional
phrases, the reverse order seems to be excluded. In sum, ň’ w oq’ar seems to be
in the middle of a process of grammaticalization from a case-marked noun to an
adposition.

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).
(974) a. zekìer-oč’č’u r-iči / r-ič-agoì

 ‘Tomorrow the water will be warm.’
b. neten de y-iči-yo q’ede!
 always I II-be-PRS IRR
 ‘May I (fem.) always be!’ (i.e. live forever)
Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).

 I I-big I-become-ANT I I-become-INF be hunter=as
 ‘When I (masc.) grow up I will become a hunter.’
If in ‘X becomes Y’ the Y is an adverb or adjective, the noun phrase denoting
the subject X is in the Absolutive case and triggers agreement:

 ‘The poor Mullah Nasredin becomes rich.’ (N)
b. hibay haw č’agu y-iq-iš goì, haw ked
 there she alive II-become-RES be that girl(II)
 ‘There she becomes alive, that girl.’ (N)
Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.
(977) a. hayìu-qo y-ese q’ono qu=čeňebu

 ‘Tomorrow will probably be a cold day.’
538 Chapter 18. Copula clauses
Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).
",66.36444091796875," There is a simple explanation as to why the AT-Essive and not another case
is used to mark non-canonical agents in causative constructions; this explanation
makes use of the hierarchy of syntactic positions: Comrie (1976b) notes that
in the paradigm case of causatives derived from transitive verbs, the causee is
likely to take the same case marking as indirect objects in ditransitive clauses.
Embedded subjects (e.g. causees) are demoted stepwise down the case hierarchy
(subject, direct object, indirect object, other obliques). Transitive verbs already
have a subject and a direct object, thus the newly added argument takes the role of
the indirect object. In Hinuq, indirect objects of ditransitive verbs like ‘give’ are
marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.

Other minor constructions
26.1. Comparative constructions
In comparative constructions two or more items are examined in order to note
similarities and differences between them (Dixon 2008: 787). Hinuq has sev-
eral ways of expressing comparative constructions. For expressing inequality
between two items, a spatial case is used (Section 26.1.1). In superlative con-
structions, degree adverbs occur (Section 26.1.2). For expressing equality or
similarity, an enclitic (Section 26.1.4) and an adverb are used (Section 26.1.5).
26.1.1. Expressing inequality with the ALOC -Lative
26.1.1.1. Standard comparative constructions
Hinuq comparative constructions consist of the comparee, which is often, but not
always the subject of the clause, the standard of comparison, and the parameter
of comparison. For standard comparative constructions, Hinuq does not employ
an index (as for instance more in English). In simple comparative constructions,
the comparee and the standard are normally expressed by noun phrases (nouns,
proper names, pronouns). The comparee is often a copula subject or in the S or
A function (1301b). The standard is marked with a spatial case, i.e. to indicate its
grammatical function, the ALOC-Lative suffix -der is added to the standard (see
Section 3.5.25 for other functions of this case). Cross-linguistically, this is rather
unusual. According to Dixon (2008: 791), in a fair number of languages the ab-
lative or locative (i.e. essive) markers are preferably employed for indicating the
standard of comparison. In fact, all other Tsezic languages have either a dedi-
cated suffix for this function (Tsez, Hunzib), or they use an Essive (Bezhta) or
a spatial case containing the Ablative (Tsez, Khwarshi). Furthermore, the ALOC
suffix is predominantly employed with animate nouns, but in comparative con-
structions animate as well as inanimate nouns and other nominalized expression
can take this case suffix. The construction is monoclausal. The word order is free.
The comparee more frequently precedes the standard of comparison (1300a), but
the reverse order is possible as well (1300b).
(1300) a. diessu dew-zo essu-de-r bercinaw goì
I.GEN 1 sister you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 sister-ALOC - LAT beautiful be

 Comparative constructions 709
 b. dew-zoessu-de-r diessu bercinaw goì
 you.SG . OBL - GEN 2 I.GEN 1 sister sister- ALOC - LAT beautiful be
 ‘My sister is more beautiful than your sister.’
In simple comparative constructions the parameter, that is, the property, in
whose respect the comparee and the standard are compared, can be just an ad-
jective (1300a), an adjective with some modifier (1301a), or an adverb (1301b),
(1303b).

 mother-ERG food(V) V-well V-do-PRS REFL . SG . GEN 2
 essu-de-r
 sister-ALOC - LAT
 ‘The mother makes the food better than her sister.’
In constructions expressing differences in age, it is possible to mark the stan-
dard of comparison not only with the ALOC-Lative, but, at least for some Hinuq
speakers alternatively with the SPR-Ablative.140
(1302)a. obu-de-r q’ w ena ňeb-aØ-Ü eži zoq’e-n hago
father-ALOC - LAT two.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be-UWPST he
 ‘He was two years older than my father.’ (N)
 b. hago di-ň’o-sìoraňeb-aØ-Ü eži goì
 he I.OBL - SPR - ABL 1 three.OBL year.OBL - IN I-big be
 ‘He is two years older than me.’
Since Hinuq does not have special comparative forms of adjectives or ad-
verbs, the standard of comparison must obligatorily occur in every comparative
construction. Otherwise the clause is just a copula construction or another kind
of simple clause. For instance, compare example (1303a) and (1303b); both are
identical except for the standard of comparison, which is absent from the first
example, but occurs in the second example.
140 My main informant sees the use of the SPR-Ablative as ungrammatical. But note that
the closely related languages Khwarshi and Tsez use the SPR -Ablative in all kinds of

For Tsez, Polinsky and Potsdam (2002) show that backward control repre-
sents a biclausal construction and not a monoclausal clause union construction.
In Hinuq not all of their arguments are applicable. Besides case assignment and
agreement, at least word order can be interpreted as pointing to a biclausal con-
struction. In (1182), which represents backward control, it is impossible for an
argument of the embedded clause to occur before the matrix verb in clause-initial
position.

That the matrix clause contains a covert agreement trigger can only be proven
by the agreement on the matrix verb. Apart form Hinuq and Tsez, backward
control exists in a few other Daghestanian languages like Tsez, Rutul (Kibrik
2003: 533), and Tsakhur (Kibrik 2003: 547), (Ljutikova & Bonč-Osmolovskaja
1999: 532); in these languages usually the phasal verb ‘begin, start’ and/or the
modal verb ‘must’ appear in this construction. Other languages outside of Dagh-
estan that exhibit backward control are Japanese, Brazilian Portugese, Korean,
and Kabardian (Polinsky & Potsdam 2006).
22.5. Summary of agreement and case assignment in complements
When looking at the patterns of agreement and case assignment in complement
clauses, there seem to be five possibilities (Table 84). The most prominent argu-
ment of the matrix clause can either have its case assigned by the matrix verb
Complement-taking adjectives, adverbs, and nouns649
itself or by the subordinate verb. However, as the example of k’ w ezi -iq- ‘be
able’ above shows (Section 22.4.6), the valency frame of the subordinate verb
can influence the case assignment of the matrix verb.

ate agreement prefix has already been proposed for several other Nakh-Daghesta-
nian languages (e.g. see Kibrik (1977: 64–66) for Archi, Nichols (1989) for Nakh
and Comrie & Polinsky (1999b) for Tsez and Hunzib). Comrie and Polinsky ex-
tend this proposal also to stem final segments. In order to establish such corre-
lations an analysis of the nominal lexicon is first necessary. Both directions of
the correlation, from classes to initial/final segments and vice versa have been
examined. After counting all 800 nouns in my material the results are given in
Tables 17-20. In these tables the abbreviation seg. refers to the segments and occ.

",tensor([27.8693])," There is a simple explanation as to why the AT-Essive and not another case

marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).
(974) a. zekìer-oč’č’u r-iči / r-ič-agoì
 tomorrow water( V) V-cold V-be / V-be- INF be
 ‘Tomorrow the water will be warm.’
b. neten de y-iči-yo q’ede!
 always I II-be-PRS IRR
 ‘May I (fem.) always be!’ (i.e. live forever)
Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).

 ‘When I (masc.) grow up I will become a hunter.’
If in ‘X becomes Y’ the Y is an adverb or adjective, the noun phrase denoting
the subject X is in the Absolutive case and triggers agreement:

 ‘The poor Mullah Nasredin becomes rich.’ (N)
b. hibay haw č’agu y-iq-iš goì, haw ked
 there she alive II-become-RES be that girl(II)
 ‘There she becomes alive, that girl.’ (N)
Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.
(977) a. hayìu-qo y-ese q’ono qu=čeňebu

 ‘Tomorrow will probably be a cold day.’
538 Chapter 18. Copula clauses
Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).

24.1.2.2. Status of the reflexive
The reflexive can be a core argument. In this case it functions as the direct object
of a transitive verb (1217a), or as the stimulus of an experiencer verb (1217b).
Note that simple reflexive pronouns normally do not appear in core argument
positions of local reflexive constructions in my corpus. Such examples can be
elicited, but monotransitive sentences with a simple reflexive pronoun in the P
position are quite marginal (1217c). At least in the experiencer construction the
order of controller and controllee can be reversed (1217d).

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).

The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-

spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).

Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).

Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.

Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).

",62.20948028564453," There is a simple explanation as to why the AT-Essive and not another case
is used to mark non-canonical agents in causative constructions; this explanation
makes use of the hierarchy of syntactic positions: Comrie (1976b) notes that
in the paradigm case of causatives derived from transitive verbs, the causee is
likely to take the same case marking as indirect objects in ditransitive clauses.
Embedded subjects (e.g. causees) are demoted stepwise down the case hierarchy
(subject, direct object, indirect object, other obliques). Transitive verbs already
have a subject and a direct object, thus the newly added argument takes the role of
the indirect object. In Hinuq, indirect objects of ditransitive verbs like ‘give’ are
marked with the Dative or with the AT-Essive (Section 16.6). In addition, the AT-
Essive is also employed to code temporary possessors. In other words, this case
is already heavily used for lower grammatical roles (in contrast to the Dative,
which is mainly used for the coding of the experiencer); therefore, causees are
also marked with it.

the transitivity of a transitive event or situation. Although its semantics is not
very clear, the function of the biabsolutive construction can be broadly described
as agent promotion in combination with patient demotion. The fact that topical-
izing enclitics cannot appear on the patient is due to this function: these enclitics
would emphasize the patient in a way that contradicts the semantics of the con-
struction as a whole. Furthermore, the patient cannot undergo left or right dislo-
cation because dislocating an expression is a way of topicalizing, and this again
would contradict the pragmatic status of the patient. Similarly, inanimate agents
are prohibited because they usually do not occur as agents; that means, they
are less topical than animate nouns. Consequently, they are completely excluded
from the biabsolutive construction that, at least to some extent, topicalizes the
agent. Another explanation for the ban of inanimate agents might be that overt
case marking on inanimate agents is needed in order to distinguish them from
the patient argument of the clause, which is often also inanimate. When both
arguments are inanimate, confusion may arise as to which argument is the pa-
tient of the clause. Example (946) also fits what has been noted for a number

tend this proposal also to stem final segments. In order to establish such corre-

the correlation, from classes to initial/final segments and vice versa have been
examined. After counting all 800 nouns in my material the results are given in

",tensor([27.6081])," A strong correlation between the initial segment of a noun and the appropri-

and Comrie & Polinsky (1999b) for Tsez and Hunzib). Comrie and Polinsky ex-
tend this proposal also to stem final segments. In order to establish such corre-
lations an analysis of the nominal lexicon is first necessary. Both directions of
the correlation, from classes to initial/final segments and vice versa have been
examined. After counting all 800 nouns in my material the results are given in
Tables 17-20. In these tables the abbreviation seg. refers to the segments and occ.

The antecedent of the reciprocal pronoun always expresses an entity in the
plural. That means that it can be a noun marked for plural (1267), a plural pro-
noun (1268d), a conjunction of nouns (1269a), a collective noun like ahlu ‘peo-
ple’ (1270), or a noun modified with any numeral besides ‘one’ (1269b).

The antecedent of the reflexive pronoun can be S, A (1268a), or an expe-
riencer (1271a). It can be the most prominent argument of a verb assigning a
spatial case. In my corpus it is predominantly an S argument.

The antecedent can be in the superordinate clause controlling a reciprocal
pronoun in the subordinate clause (1268d), (1272a, 1272b). Often it is not overtly
expressed in the clause but can be retrieved from the context (1268b), (1269c).
The word order of antencedent and reciprocal pronoun can be reversed.
"," There has been some discussion concerning pharyngealization in Hinuq and
in other Tsezic languages (cf. Kibrik & Kodzasov (1990), Maddieson et al.
(1996), Comrie (2003a), Grawunder et al. (2009)). The precise nature and the
historical development of pharyngealization remains a subject of debate. Lom-
tadze (1963: 23) claims that pharyngealization developed under the influence of
the neighboring language Tsez. Imnajšvili (1963: 19) states that pharyngealiza-
tion and the pharyngeal fricative /Ü/ developed from the glottal stop. Isakov and
Khalilov (2004: 173, 2005: 567) argue that pharyngealization is a feature of the
vowels /a/ and /e/.

24.1.2.2. Status of the reflexive
The reflexive can be a core argument. In this case it functions as the direct object
of a transitive verb (1217a), or as the stimulus of an experiencer verb (1217b).
Note that simple reflexive pronouns normally do not appear in core argument
positions of local reflexive constructions in my corpus. Such examples can be
elicited, but monotransitive sentences with a simple reflexive pronoun in the P
position are quite marginal (1217c). At least in the experiencer construction the
order of controller and controllee can be reversed (1217d).

18.9. Other verbs used in copula-clauses
Since the morphological paradigm of the copula verbs is defective, three other
verbs are also employed in copula clauses. In copula clauses with future time
reference expressed for instance in the General tense or the Compound Future,
and with Imperative or Optative mood, the verbs -iči- ‘be, stand, sit’ and -iq- ‘be,
become, happen’ are used. There is a clear difference in meaning between the
two verbs. The first verb -iči- is used in normal copula clauses expressing e.g.
future time reference or non-indicative moods (974a, 974b).
(974) a. zekìer-oč’č’u r-iči / r-ič-agoì

b. neten de y-iči-yo q’ede!
 always I II-be-PRS IRR
 ‘May I (fem.) always be!’ (i.e. live forever)
Other verbs used in copula-clauses 537
The second verb -iq- when appearing in copula clauses is best translated with
‘become’. In phrases of the form ‘X becomes Y’ where X and Y are both noun
phrases, the noun phrase denoting the original object (X) takes the Abstract suffix
plus the Second Genitive, whereas the noun phrase denoting the new object (Y)
is in the Absolutive case and triggers the agreement (975a). The noun phrase
denoting the original object (X) can be replaced by a quantifier (975b). If the
new object (Y) is a profession, then it is marked with the enclitic =ìun (975c).

the subject X is in the Absolutive case and triggers agreement:

b. hibay haw č’agu y-iq-iš goì, haw ked

 ‘There she becomes alive, that girl.’ (N)
Another verb used in copula clauses expressing epistemic modality is -ese-
‘be probable’ (for more examples see Section 8.2.2.1). This verb can be com-
bined with the other two verbs.

538 Chapter 18. Copula clauses
Based on the copula, a few converbs and participles can be built, but for the
majority of converbal and participial forms of ‘be’, the verbs -iči- and -iq- must
be employed (see Section 7.8.3 for the forms and some examples).

"," Beginning from the 1970’s Kibrik and Kodzasov organized many field trips
from Moscow State University to Daghestan in order to study Daghestanian
languages. Material about Hinuq syntax can be found in Materialy k tipologii
èrgativnosti (‘Materials on the typology of ergativity’) from 1980 and 1981, and
alternatively in a newer version of these books by Kibrik (2003), and partially
also in Kibrik (1987). Furthermore, Kibrik & Kodzasov (1990) contains descrip-
tions of the phonology and the case formation in many Daghestanian languages,
including Hinuq.

",58.0," There has been some discussion concerning pharyngealization in Hinuq and
in other Tsezic languages (cf. Kibrik & Kodzasov (1990), Maddieson et al.
(1996), Comrie (2003a), Grawunder et al. (2009)). The precise nature and the
historical development of pharyngealization remains a subject of debate. Lom-
tadze (1963: 23) claims that pharyngealization developed under the influence of
the neighboring language Tsez. Imnajšvili (1963: 19) states that pharyngealiza-
tion and the pharyngeal fricative /Ü/ developed from the glottal stop. Isakov and
Khalilov (2004: 173, 2005: 567) argue that pharyngealization is a feature of the
vowels /a/ and /e/.

Table 3 presents the consonant inventory of Hinuq. In this table, the three series
of stops are, in the given order: voiceless nonejective, voiceless ejective, and
voiced. The two series of fricatives are voiceless and voiced. The two series of
affricates are voiceless nonejective and voiceless ejective. In every box the first
