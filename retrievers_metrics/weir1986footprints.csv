2. General overview of some features of Nadtb
The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information
about Nadeb grammar to facilitate an understanding of the hypothesis
presented in this paper. For a fuller description of several aspects of the
grammar, see Weir (1984).
2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure
The structures of the sentence and of the verb, postpositional, and noun
phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified
expansions:
S4 (NP) NP VP(PP)
 I IPP \NP
 1bdv f
VP --tIncV
PP -+NPP
NP 4 N
 S Det
 I S
In the expansion S + (NP) NP VP (PP), the first NP functions as direct
object and the second as subject, i.e. Nadeb has a basic constituent order OSV,

Det represents the head of the relative clause, and is realized by one of two
determiners;doo, indicating specific reference, and peh, indicating non-specific
(including hypothetical)reference. The expansionNP + S describes the
structure of headless relative clauses. In NadEb, headless relative clauses and
other relative clauses represent two different relativizationstrategies, and a
headless relative clause cannot be considered merely as a relative clause whose
head has been deleted. Headless relative clauses allow wider possibilitiesfor
the constituents which can be relativized,and generallyoccur in contexts
different from those of other relative clauses.5

Nadeb verb prefixes are classifiedin six types, as summarized below.
(i) The formative prefix, a-, which generally accompaniesa main verb root
in the absence of other prefixes, elements incorporated into the VP, or
proclitic pronouns; i.e. the prefix a- is inserted in an empty Inc in the
surface structure, in the absence of a proclitic pronoun which would be
attached to the verb.

 contexts with some verbs and only in certain contexts with others.

along with the incorporated postposition form, but with a strong
preference for the prefixed form (section 4).

incorporated postposition form, is acceptable. In main clauses, for a
few verbs, there is a semantic change in the prefixed form, as opposed
to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).

prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-

a series of voiced stops: b, d, d, (written j), and g, the last two of which have a voiceless glotalized

vowels: w, y, and h, and an alveolar tap consonant(written 1). The oral vowel system consistsof
unrounded front vowels: i, e, and E (written C); unrounded non-front vowels: i (writteni),
e (written u), L (written ck), and a, and roundedback vowels: u, o, and o (written6). The nasalized
vowel system consists of non-rounded front vowels i, and Z (written i); non-roundednon-front
vowels: ‘r (written i), and 1, and rounded back vowels ti, and 5 (written 6). Vowels which are
nasalized by virtue of their proximity to a nasal consonant are not marked by a tilde in the written
form. There is a featureof length which can occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby repetition of
the vowel letter, for example, aa for /a:/. The nasalization of a long vowel is indicatedonly on the
first of the two letters, for example, Ha for /a:/. There is a feature of laryngealizationwhich can
occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby x precedingthe vowel letter, for example, xa for /A/.

different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in
a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

2.2. Classification, form, and ordering of verb prefixes
Nadeb verb prefixes are classifiedin six types, as summarized below.
(i) The formative prefix, a-, which generally accompaniesa main verb root
in the absence of other prefixes, elements incorporated into the VP, or
proclitic pronouns; i.e. the prefix a- is inserted in an empty Inc in the
surface structure, in the absence of a proclitic pronoun which would be
attached to the verb.
(ii) The multi-function aspect prefix, i-, which occurs obligatorily in all
 contexts with some verbs and only in certain contexts with others.

to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).

prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-
tains a headless relative clause (section 6).

2.2. Classification, form, and ordering of verb prefixes
Nadeb verb prefixes are classifiedin six types, as summarized below.
(i) The formative prefix, a-, which generally accompaniesa main verb root
in the absence of other prefixes, elements incorporated into the VP, or

 contexts with some verbs and only in certain contexts with others.

it affects an increasing proportion of relevant lexical items. These features - change affecting a
restricted number of items, variants existing side by side, and the newer form spreading to all
relevant items and eventually replacing the older - are also seen in the process of syntactic change
discussed in this paper. Compare also Naro’s work (1981) on the spread of syntactic change in

the direct object is separated from the verb in the basic order, it would not be
very meaningful to speak of such a ‘verb phrase’.
",70.55767059326172," A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

",72.29166412353516," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The

2. General overview of some features of Nadtb
The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information
about Nadeb grammar to facilitate an understanding of the hypothesis
presented in this paper. For a fuller description of several aspects of the
grammar, see Weir (1984).
2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure
The structures of the sentence and of the verb, postpositional, and noun
phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified
expansions:
S4 (NP) NP VP(PP)
 I IPP \NP
 1bdv f
VP --tIncV
PP -+NPP
NP 4 N
 S Det

object and the second as subject, i.e. Nadeb has a basic constituent order OSV,

subordination prefixes is Ca-, but the prefix nearest to the aspect prefix, when

prefix occurs with the same verb root, their relative order is determinedby
surface form, rather than by types or meanings.",39.7144660949707,"In the expansionof the VP, V representsthe verbroot(s) and suffix(es),

use of the term ‘verb phrase’ differs from that of various linguists, for whom
this term refers to the verb plus its complement(direct object). In NadEb, since
the direct object is separated from the verb in the basic order, it would not be
very meaningful to speak of such a ‘verb phrase’.

but not at all with others, and whose meaning is often difficult or
impossible to isolate from that of the root. A verb may have more than
one *thematic prefix. Some obligatory prefixes have a fairly clear
connectionwith derivationalprefixes, as in the case of the ka- in ka-
koon ‘crawl’, which is probably the derivationalreflexive prefix. How-
ever, when the verb root cannot occur without the prefix, as in this case
(cf. *a-koon), the latter is regarded as thematic rather than derivational.
 (v)The relational prefixes, which change the grammatical relations within
the sentence, such as ya- ‘on top of’, ga- ‘inside’.
 (vi) The subordination prefixes, which occur in certain embedded clauses,
and, in the case of relative and headless relative clauses, indicate the
grammatical function of the relativized (and deleted) constituent;for
example, ma- ‘relativized means’ (glossed RM in the examples), ba-
‘relativized adverbial’ (glossed RA).
This paper will be concernedprimarilywith relational,subordination and
derivationalprefixes. Thematic prefixes will be considered only briefly.

The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information
about Nadeb grammar to facilitate an understanding of the hypothesis
presented in this paper. For a fuller description of several aspects of the
grammar, see Weir (1984).
2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure

phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified

porated element.
2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.

use of the term ‘verb phrase’ differs from that of various linguists, for whom

the direct object is separated from the verb in the basic order, it would not be
very meaningful to speak of such a ‘verb phrase’.

the presence of some of the many verb prefixes in an OV language.
",68.87466430664062,4,0.8395636708773342," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

and, in the case of relative and headless relative clauses, indicate the
grammatical function of the relativized (and deleted) constituent;for

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but

rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information

2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure

phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified

which my father shoots’.8 In this headless relative clause, the prefix ma-
indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).
(10a) ee a-gti tabb6
 father formative-be = in = hammock house ablative
 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.","Several unusual features, some very peripheral to the present topic of study,
have been noted in passing. These include basic word order, prefix ordering
rule, restricted choice of relative clause head, and the whole area of incorpora-
tion into the verb phrase. These, and other areas of Nadeb, will be the subject
of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

vowel system consists of non-rounded front vowels i, and Z (written i); non-roundednon-front
vowels: ‘r (written i), and 1, and rounded back vowels ti, and 5 (written 6). Vowels which are
nasalized by virtue of their proximity to a nasal consonant are not marked by a tilde in the written
form. There is a featureof length which can occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby repetition of
the vowel letter, for example, aa for /a:/. The nasalization of a long vowel is indicatedonly on the
first of the two letters, for example, Ha for /a:/. There is a feature of laryngealizationwhich can
occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby x precedingthe vowel letter, for example, xa for /A/.
",70.68501281738281," A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that

2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.

",32.42253875732422," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

structure of headless relative clauses. In NadEb, headless relative clauses and
other relative clauses represent two different relativizationstrategies, and a
headless relative clause cannot be considered merely as a relative clause whose
head has been deleted. Headless relative clauses allow wider possibilitiesfor
the constituents which can be relativized,and generallyoccur in contexts
different from those of other relative clauses.5
2.2. Classification, form, and ordering of verb prefixes
Nadeb verb prefixes are classifiedin six types, as summarized below.
(i) The formative prefix, a-, which generally accompaniesa main verb root
in the absence of other prefixes, elements incorporated into the VP, or
proclitic pronouns; i.e. the prefix a- is inserted in an empty Inc in the
surface structure, in the absence of a proclitic pronoun which would be
attached to the verb.
(ii) The multi-function aspect prefix, i-, which occurs obligatorily in all
 contexts with some verbs and only in certain contexts with others.
4 Argumentsin support of the statement that Nadeb basic constituent order is OSV include
intuition, both that of the linguist in question and that of native speakers; the pattern of nominal

7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP

 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which

examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

it affects an increasing proportion of relevant lexical items. These features - change affecting a
restricted number of items, variants existing side by side, and the newer form spreading to all
relevant items and eventually replacing the older - are also seen in the process of syntactic change
discussed in this paper. Compare also Naro’s work (1981) on the spread of syntactic change in

@a), and (10a).

indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",30.35997200012207,0,0.7557679880067694," The prefix mu- occurs in the verb only when the instrumentalPP

prefix occurs with the same verb root, their relative order is determinedby

the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

for verb prefixes.

",67.91647338867188," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An

noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to

 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.

precedes the verb, and even then this prefix is not always used. The form of
(8f), without the prefix ma-, is also acceptable, although much less frequent
than either (8a) or (8e).
(8f)sx66wmecci-s66m
blowgun by = means = of father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun

In (8f) the PP has been fronted (probablyto a position of focus) without
change in the grammaticalrelations in the sentence. Example (se), however, is
a cleft sentence (equative clause), in which the complementis the PP sx6&v

application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head

concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.
"," 6) The postposition y6 ‘on top of’.’ There is, for some verbs only, along
with the incorporated postposition form a verb prefix variant identical
in meaning. The incorporated and prefixed forms cannot occur in the
same sentence with a PP which contains the corresponding postposition
(section 3).
 (ii) The-postposition hC ‘dative’. The verb prefix variant exists for all verbs
along with the incorporated postposition form, but with a strong
preference for the prefixed form (section 4).
 (iii) The postposition g6 ‘inside’. Only the prefixed form, and not the
incorporated postposition form, is acceptable. In main clauses, for a
few verbs, there is a semantic change in the prefixed form, as opposed
to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).
 (iv)The postposition me ‘by means of’. The semantic change in the
prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-
tains a headless relative clause (section 6).

allophone which occurs in syllable-initialposition; a series of nasals: m, n, fi (written nh), and n
(written ng), with pre-stopped allophonesafter oral vowels, for example, [a”m]; a series of semi-
vowels: w, y, and h, and an alveolar tap consonant(written 1). The oral vowel system consistsof
unrounded front vowels: i, e, and E (written C); unrounded non-front vowels: i (writteni),
e (written u), L (written ck), and a, and roundedback vowels: u, o, and o (written6). The nasalized
vowel system consists of non-rounded front vowels i, and Z (written i); non-roundednon-front
vowels: ‘r (written i), and 1, and rounded back vowels ti, and 5 (written 6). Vowels which are
nasalized by virtue of their proximity to a nasal consonant are not marked by a tilde in the written
form. There is a featureof length which can occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby repetition of
the vowel letter, for example, aa for /a:/. The nasalization of a long vowel is indicatedonly on the
first of the two letters, for example, Ha for /a:/. There is a feature of laryngealizationwhich can
occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby x precedingthe vowel letter, for example, xa for /A/.
",67.23486328125,"Several unusual features, some very peripheral to the present topic of study,
have been noted in passing. These include basic word order, prefix ordering
rule, restricted choice of relative clause head, and the whole area of incorpora-
tion into the verb phrase. These, and other areas of Nadeb, will be the subject
of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.
",70.68257141113281," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last
I1 Table 2 does not include all uses of prefixes of these surface forms. There are, for example,
thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.
",69.16954040527344,"312E. M. H. Weir / Nadt?b verb prejxes: diachronic development
 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’

blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.
",77.73297882080078," The prefix mu- occurs in the verb only when the instrumentalPP

 8.2. In relation to relative clauses
 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),
 respectively(examples(6e), (8d), and (10~)).

(8d)etmi-soom doo
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(10~) et- ba-gk doo
‘the one in which my father is’
In each case the function of the prefix is to advance the modifier NP in a PP to
direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",62.633331298828125,0,0.4134990745531602," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).
 (3a) kalaptt ka-mi-hxaak

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

(4d) *kalapeC ha salaap ha-dung
In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha
measles thematic + aspect-fall + multiplechildren dative
‘The children caught measles.’ (Lit., ‘Measles fell on the children’.)

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’

‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.

of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two

relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-

of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).
"," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last

thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-

indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",65.90447998046875," Lightfoot points out some of the deficienciesof,

 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax

limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely

The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).
",60.81534194946289,0,0.9508970399884572," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last
I1 Table 2 does not include all uses of prefixes of these surface forms. There are, for example,
thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.

tion thus incorporated into the VP cannot at the same time occur in the PP
from which it was extracted, i.e. the process is not one of concordance.

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

 (2c) *bxaah y6 kalapee y6 sooh

 In example(2d), however, a furtherdevelopment is seen. The incorporated
postposition yb has become phonologically attached to the verb root and its
vowel changed, in accordance with the general form of verb prefixes, Ca-.

 (2e) *bxaah yo kalapeeya-sooh
As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

diffusion,whichWangdescribesas ‘one of the primary meansthroughwhich a sound change
implementsitself’ (1969:15). During the initial phase, a sound change affects only a few lexical
items. Some morphemesmay changedirectly to the new pronunciation, while othersat first have
the two pronunciations, the older graduallybeing replacedby the newer. As the change progresses,
it affects an increasing proportion of relevant lexical items. These features - change affecting a
restricted number of items, variants existing side by side, and the newer form spreading to all
relevant items and eventually replacing the older - are also seen in the process of syntactic change
discussed in this paper. Compare also Naro’s work (1981) on the spread of syntactic change in
modernBrazilianPortuguese, basedon a quantitativestudyof the application of 3rd person
subject/verb agreement among certain classes of speaker.","The present behaviourof these postpositionsand verb prefixes and the
different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in
a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with
any adverbial in pre-verbal position, except PPs of means and those which
contain an object of comparison. With the former the prefix ma- (discussed in
the previous section) is used, while the latter do not occur in cleft sentences.
This is illustrated with a temporal adverb, yiti ‘tomorrow’ in (1 la); with an

8. Comparison of the behaviour of the verb prefixes ga-, ma-, and ba-
 It is now possible to compare the behaviour of the three prefixes ga- ‘inside’,
ma- ‘by means of’, and ba- ‘ablative’, starting with the intransitive clauses (6a),
@a), and (10a).
",32.092315673828125," The aspect prefix, i-, when present, occurs in position nearest to the main

prefix occurs with the same verb root, their relative order is determinedby
surface form, rather than by types or meanings.",69.74455261230469,"Weir / Nadtib verb prefixes: diachronic development305

indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",68.76641845703125," It is not possible,
however, to say which na- precedes the other, since they are identical in form and never separated

porated element.
2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.
",76.88798522949219," The next postpositionsto be subjected to this process will
 probably be those whose forms are most similar to those of prefixes, viz. pa

prefix na- does not exclude any of these three prefixes, in accordance with their
interpretation as relational, rather than subordination, prefixes (examples (6g),
(8g), and (1Of)).

(1 Of) et ba-na-gti doo

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).
",62.62410736083984,0,0.9275682602851184,"312E. M. H. Weir / Nadt?b verb prejxes: diachronic development
 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’
 (8~) sx66wetmi-s&m
blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.
",62.44440841674805,0,0.4559018732818102," From the unacceptability of (le) and (If), it can be seen that the postposi-
tion thus incorporated into the VP cannot at the same time occur in the PP
from which it was extracted, i.e. the process is not one of concordance.

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

",26.17929649353028,0,0.829620644625028," The prefix mu- occurs in the verb only when the instrumentalPP

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).
",64.40476989746094,0,0.9376611142967772,"In the case of the postpositiong6 ‘inside’, there is at least a strong

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

",65.713134765625," Thus, the study of Nadeb verb prefixes providesan example of the
application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).
",66.79673767089844," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last
I1 Table 2 does not include all uses of prefixes of these surface forms. There are, for example,
thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.
",30.43610382080078," Lightfoot points out some of the deficienciesof,
among other things, one of the fairly generally accepted basic assumptions of
internal reconstruction, viz. that ‘morphologicalpatterns will partially recapi-
 tulate the syntax of an earlier stage of the language in a consistent way’ (1979:
 160). He shows that morphology is not only ‘very slow to adapt to syntactic
changes, but also it mirrors earlier syntax only in a selective way’, concluding
 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax
because, while each of the individual forms reconstructed may be accurate,
 there is no reason to suppose that they each reflect the same earlier stage,
whether they reflect the syntax of 500, 1000 or 2000 years ago’ (1979: 161).
This last point is also made by Chafe (1959: 481). In the light of its
limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely
as a prelude to the comparative method.

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

uncertainty about the use of ma- in the negative. Some speakers prefer the

292 E. M. H. Weir / NadCb verb preJxes:diachronic developmenl
Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.

precedes the verb, and even then this prefix is not always used. The form of

different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in
a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.
",65.33844757080078,"However, because of the already mentionedlack of available data from
previousstages of Nadeb or from related languages,the arguments here
presented are of necessity based solely on internalsynchronic evidence.

modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).

 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",62.58764266967773,0,0.9275682602851184," The prefix mu- occurs in the verb only when the instrumentalPP

koon ‘crawl’, which is probably the derivationalreflexive prefix. How-
ever, when the verb root cannot occur without the prefix, as in this case
(cf. *a-koon), the latter is regarded as thematic rather than derivational.

the sentence, such as ya- ‘on top of’, ga- ‘inside’.

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.

We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as

 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with
any adverbial in pre-verbal position, except PPs of means and those which
contain an object of comparison. With the former the prefix ma- (discussed in
the previous section) is used, while the latter do not occur in cleft sentences.
This is illustrated with a temporal adverb, yiti ‘tomorrow’ in (1 la); with an
adverb of manner, kayah ‘slowly’ in (12); with an indirect object, kalaptt hG
‘to the child’ in (13), and with another PP, hx66h g6 ‘in a canoe’ in (6f). All
these forms are interpreted as cleft sentences, and the prefix ba- indicates in
each case that the subject is a headless relative clause in which the relativized
constituent is an adverbial.

ma- ‘by means of’, and ba- ‘ablative’, starting with the intransitive clauses (6a),
@a), and (10a).
",30.03670883178711,"In the case of the postpositiong6 ‘inside’, there is at least a strong
preference for the use of a relative clause as modifying NP (example (Isa)).

In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

8.5. Summary
In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

Nadtib, but rather to present a hypothesis concerningthe origin of certain verb
prefixes based on internal synchronicevidence. Before considering this hypo-
thesis in detail, an understanding, in general terms, of some features of Nadeb
is necessary. Section 2 provides this backgroundinformation,dealing prin-

 examples, the system of verb prefixes, and the grammatical rule which
currently allows incorporation of (most) postpositions into the verb phrase.

with the incorporated postposition form a verb prefix variant identical
in meaning. The incorporated and prefixed forms cannot occur in the
same sentence with a PP which contains the corresponding postposition

 (ii) The-postposition hC ‘dative’. The verb prefix variant exists for all verbs
along with the incorporated postposition form, but with a strong
preference for the prefixed form (section 4).
 (iii) The postposition g6 ‘inside’. Only the prefixed form, and not the
incorporated postposition form, is acceptable. In main clauses, for a
few verbs, there is a semantic change in the prefixed form, as opposed
to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).
 (iv)The postposition me ‘by means of’. The semantic change in the
prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-
tains a headless relative clause (section 6).
 (v) The postposition bti ‘ablative’. The prefixed form does not occur in
 main clauses, but only in relative and headless relative clauses. Such a
rThe Nadebconsonant system consistsof a series of voiceless stops: p, t, S (writtens), and k;
a series of voiced stops: b, d, d, (written j), and g, the last two of which have a voiceless glotalized
allophone which occurs in syllable-initialposition; a series of nasals: m, n, fi (written nh), and n
(written ng), with pre-stopped allophonesafter oral vowels, for example, [a”m]; a series of semi-
vowels: w, y, and h, and an alveolar tap consonant(written 1). The oral vowel system consistsof
unrounded front vowels: i, e, and E (written C); unrounded non-front vowels: i (writteni),
e (written u), L (written ck), and a, and roundedback vowels: u, o, and o (written6). The nasalized
vowel system consists of non-rounded front vowels i, and Z (written i); non-roundednon-front
vowels: ‘r (written i), and 1, and rounded back vowels ti, and 5 (written 6). Vowels which are
nasalized by virtue of their proximity to a nasal consonant are not marked by a tilde in the written
form. There is a featureof length which can occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby repetition of
the vowel letter, for example, aa for /a:/. The nasalization of a long vowel is indicatedonly on the
first of the two letters, for example, Ha for /a:/. There is a feature of laryngealizationwhich can
occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby x precedingthe vowel letter, for example, xa for /A/.

 This non-cooccurrenceof the prefix ba- with the negative na- is in contrastto
 their cooccurrencein (lOf), which confirms that here ba- functionsas a
 subordination prefix, while in (1Of) it functions as a relational prefix.
8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).
",29.04145050048828,0,0.798909460300548," From the unacceptability of (le) and (If), it can be seen that the postposi-
tion thus incorporated into the VP cannot at the same time occur in the PP
from which it was extracted, i.e. the process is not one of concordance.
 (le) *kad mahang w&t Nadub mahang
 (1 f) *Nadub mahang kad mahang w&t
3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.
 (2a) kalapee a-soohbxaah yb
 child formative-be = sitting tree on=top=of
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’
 (2b) bxaah kalapee yb sooh
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child is on-sitting the
 tree’.)
 (2c) *bxaah y6 kalapee y6 sooh
300 E. M. H. Weir 1 NadCb verb prefixes: diachronic developmem
 In example(2d), however, a furtherdevelopment is seen. The incorporated
postposition yb has become phonologically attached to the verb root and its
vowel changed, in accordance with the general form of verb prefixes, Ca-.
 (2d) bxaahkalapet ya-sooh
 treechild on = top= of-be = sitting
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child is on-sittingthe
 tree’.)
 (2e) *bxaah yo kalapeeya-sooh
As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

 different pattern, as summarized below.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).
","In the case of the postpositiong6 ‘inside’, there is at least a strong
preference for the use of a relative clause as modifying NP (example (Isa)).
Some speakers demonstrate uncertaintyas to the acceptability of a headless
relative clause in this context, while others reject this form (example (1 Sb)).

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).
",65.15299224853516," The next postpositionsto be subjected to this process will
 probably be those whose forms are most similar to those of prefixes, viz. pa
 ‘beside’ (examples (17ac)), and wti ‘beside’ (examples (18a-c)).",66.49462127685547," For example, the prefixes ya-, da-, ta- and la- follow na- and precede ha-; ya- precedes

prefix na- may co-occur with another na- prefix (derivational or thematic).",29.9792709350586," 296 E. M. H. Weir 1 NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development

precedes the verb, and even then this prefix is not always used. The form of

subordination prefixes is Ca-, but the prefix nearest to the aspect prefix, when
this exists, combines with it, resulting in the form CL. When more than one
prefix occurs with the same verb root, their relative order is determinedby
surface form, rather than by types or meanings.",76.3654556274414," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child on-stops-to-rest

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),

direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",28.482046127319336,0,0.798909460300548,"The purpose of this paper is not so much to reconstruct an earlier syntax of
Nadtib, but rather to present a hypothesis concerningthe origin of certain verb
prefixes based on internal synchronicevidence. Before considering this hypo-

is necessary. Section 2 provides this backgroundinformation,dealing prin-

 (iv) The thematic prefixes, which occur obligatorilywith certain verb roots,
but not at all with others, and whose meaning is often difficult or
impossible to isolate from that of the root. A verb may have more than
one *thematic prefix. Some obligatory prefixes have a fairly clear
connectionwith derivationalprefixes, as in the case of the ka- in ka-
koon ‘crawl’, which is probably the derivationalreflexive prefix. How-
ever, when the verb root cannot occur without the prefix, as in this case
(cf. *a-koon), the latter is regarded as thematic rather than derivational.
 (v)The relational prefixes, which change the grammatical relations within
the sentence, such as ya- ‘on top of’, ga- ‘inside’.
 (vi) The subordination prefixes, which occur in certain embedded clauses,
and, in the case of relative and headless relative clauses, indicate the
grammatical function of the relativized (and deleted) constituent;for
example, ma- ‘relativized means’ (glossed RM in the examples), ba-
‘relativized adverbial’ (glossed RA).
This paper will be concernedprimarilywith relational,subordination and
derivationalprefixes. Thematic prefixes will be considered only briefly.

 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition

 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).
",76.272216796875," 6) The postposition y6 ‘on top of’.’ There is, for some verbs only, along
with the incorporated postposition form a verb prefix variant identical
in meaning. The incorporated and prefixed forms cannot occur in the
same sentence with a PP which contains the corresponding postposition
(section 3).
 (ii) The-postposition hC ‘dative’. The verb prefix variant exists for all verbs
along with the incorporated postposition form, but with a strong
preference for the prefixed form (section 4).
 (iii) The postposition g6 ‘inside’. Only the prefixed form, and not the
incorporated postposition form, is acceptable. In main clauses, for a
few verbs, there is a semantic change in the prefixed form, as opposed
to the sentence with the equivalent PP (section 5).
 (iv)The postposition me ‘by means of’. The semantic change in the
prefixed form in main clauses applies to almost all verbs. The prefixed
 form can also appear in a sentence which contains a PP with the
 corresponding postposition, in a cleft sentence construction that con-
tains a headless relative clause (section 6).

 main clauses, but only in relative and headless relative clauses. Such a

nasalized by virtue of their proximity to a nasal consonant are not marked by a tilde in the written
form. There is a featureof length which can occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby repetition of
the vowel letter, for example, aa for /a:/. The nasalization of a long vowel is indicatedonly on the
first of the two letters, for example, Ha for /a:/. There is a feature of laryngealizationwhich can
occur with all vowels, and is indicatedby x precedingthe vowel letter, for example, xa for /A/.

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but

rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing

Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).

Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.

In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha

which my father shoots’.8 In this headless relative clause, the prefix ma-
indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).
(10a) ee a-gti tabb6
 father formative-be = in = hammock house ablative
 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",65.18553924560547,0,0.9521213706109554," A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).

prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

 tree’.)

 In example(2d), however, a furtherdevelopment is seen. The incorporated
postposition yb has become phonologically attached to the verb root and its
vowel changed, in accordance with the general form of verb prefixes, Ca-.

 treechild on = top= of-be = sitting
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child is on-sittingthe

 (2e) *bxaah yo kalapeeya-sooh
As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",64.50101470947266,"Section 9 shows that the origin of some verb prefixes can be traced one
stage further back, in that several postpositions can be seen to have originated
from nouns or demonstrative locative words. Section 10 attempts to suggest
the possible future course of the process of prefixation, and mentions its
relevance to other types of verb prefixes.
2. General overview of some features of Nadtb
The purpose of this section is to give sufficient background information
about Nadeb grammar to facilitate an understanding of the hypothesis
presented in this paper. For a fuller description of several aspects of the
grammar, see Weir (1984).
2.1. Basic sentence and phrase structure
The structures of the sentence and of the verb, postpositional, and noun
phrases in the examples in this paper can be represented by the simplified
expansions:
S4 (NP) NP VP(PP)
 I IPP \NP
 1bdv f
VP --tIncV
PP -+NPP
NP 4 N
 S Det
 I S
In the expansion S + (NP) NP VP (PP), the first NP functions as direct
object and the second as subject, i.e. Nadeb has a basic constituent order OSV,
3 Prefixes are usually associated more with VO than with OV languages.",66.07785034179688," 308E. M. H. Weir 1 Nad2b verb prefixes: diachronic development
 8.2. In relation to relative clauses
 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),
 respectively(examples(6e), (8d), and (10~)).
(6e)t% ga-hing doo
father inside-go = downriver the = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
(8d)etmi-soom doo
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(10~) et- ba-gk doo
‘the one in which my father is’
In each case the function of the prefix is to advance the modifier NP in a PP to
direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",29.527755737304688," Language 35, 477495.
Given,Talmy, 1971. Historicalsyntax and synchronic morphology:an archaeologist’sfield trip.
",31.01478576660156," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last
I1 Table 2 does not include all uses of prefixes of these surface forms. There are, for example,
thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.

 8.2. In relation to relative clauses
 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),
 respectively(examples(6e), (8d), and (10~)).
(6e)t% ga-hing doo

‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
(8d)etmi-soom doo
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(10~) et- ba-gk doo
‘the one in which my father is’
In each case the function of the prefix is to advance the modifier NP in a PP to
direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",67.67035675048828," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",75.76966857910156," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An

noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to

have been noted in passing. These include basic word order, prefix ordering

of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example

however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

 In example(2d), however, a furtherdevelopment is seen. The incorporated
postposition yb has become phonologically attached to the verb root and its
vowel changed, in accordance with the general form of verb prefixes, Ca-.

 treechild on = top= of-be = sitting

 (2e) *bxaah yo kalapeeya-sooh
As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

(1 Of) et ba-na-gti doo
‘the one in which my father is not’
8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",67.65301513671875,"In the case of the postpositiong6 ‘inside’, there is at least a strong
preference for the use of a relative clause as modifying NP (example (Isa)).
Some speakers demonstrate uncertaintyas to the acceptability of a headless
relative clause in this context, while others reject this form (example (1 Sb)).

8.5. Summary
In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.
",75.24873352050781,"Weir / Nadtib verb prefixes: diachronic development305
which my father shoots’.8 In this headless relative clause, the prefix ma-
indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).
(10a) ee a-gti tabb6
 father formative-be = in = hammock house ablative
 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",59.83286666870117,0,0.9508970399884572,"306E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes: diachronic developmem

 house ablative father RA-be = in = hammock
 ‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
 (10e) tabbQte a-gti
 house ablative father formative-be = in = hammock
 ‘In the house my father is.’
 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with
any adverbial in pre-verbal position, except PPs of means and those which
contain an object of comparison. With the former the prefix ma- (discussed in
the previous section) is used, while the latter do not occur in cleft sentences.
This is illustrated with a temporal adverb, yiti ‘tomorrow’ in (1 la); with an
adverb of manner, kayah ‘slowly’ in (12); with an indirect object, kalaptt hG
‘to the child’ in (13), and with another PP, hx66h g6 ‘in a canoe’ in (6f). All
these forms are interpreted as cleft sentences, and the prefix ba- indicates in
each case that the subject is a headless relative clause in which the relativized
constituent is an adverbial.

from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An

noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

 house ablative father RA-be = in = hammock
 ‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
 (10e) tabbQte a-gti
 house ablative father formative-be = in = hammock
 ‘In the house my father is.’
 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with
any adverbial in pre-verbal position, except PPs of means and those which
contain an object of comparison. With the former the prefix ma- (discussed in
the previous section) is used, while the latter do not occur in cleft sentences.
This is illustrated with a temporal adverb, yiti ‘tomorrow’ in (1 la); with an
adverb of manner, kayah ‘slowly’ in (12); with an indirect object, kalaptt hG
‘to the child’ in (13), and with another PP, hx66h g6 ‘in a canoe’ in (6f). All
these forms are interpreted as cleft sentences, and the prefix ba- indicates in
each case that the subject is a headless relative clause in which the relativized
constituent is an adverbial.

8. Comparison of the behaviour of the verb prefixes ga-, ma-, and ba-
 It is now possible to compare the behaviour of the three prefixes ga- ‘inside’,
ma- ‘by means of’, and ba- ‘ablative’, starting with the intransitive clauses (6a),
@a), and (10a).
",64.36150360107422,"312E. M. H. Weir / Nadt?b verb prejxes: diachronic development
 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’
 (8~) sx66wetmi-s&m
blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.
",65.99027252197266," From the unacceptability of (le) and (If), it can be seen that the postposi-
tion thus incorporated into the VP cannot at the same time occur in the PP
from which it was extracted, i.e. the process is not one of concordance.

3. The postposition yb and the verb prefix ya- ‘on top of’
 With this background information on verb prefixes and the rule which
allows incorporation of postpositions into the VP, let us now consider the
incorporation of the postposition y6 ‘on top of’ into the VP, as illustrated in
examples (2a-e) and (3a-c). In (2a-c) the situation is identical to that of the
postposition mahang ‘among’ examined in the previous section. The postposi-
tion y6 of (2a) may be incorporated into the VP (2b), resulting in the advance
of the NP dominated by the PP to direct object of the new VP y6 sooh.

 child formative-be = sitting tree on=top=of
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’

 tree’.)
 (2c) *bxaah y6 kalapee y6 sooh
300 E. M. H. Weir 1 NadCb verb prefixes: diachronic developmem
 In example(2d), however, a furtherdevelopment is seen. The incorporated
postposition yb has become phonologically attached to the verb root and its
vowel changed, in accordance with the general form of verb prefixes, Ca-.
 (2d) bxaahkalapet ya-sooh
 treechild on = top= of-be = sitting
 ‘The child is sitting on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child is on-sittingthe
 tree’.)
 (2e) *bxaah yo kalapeeya-sooh
As in the case of the incorporatedpostposition,the prefix ya- cannot be
considereda mark of concordance(compare examples (2~) and (2e)). The
function of the prefix ya- in (2d) is identical to that of the incorporated
postposition y6 in (2b), viz. that of changing the grammaticalrelations within
the sentence. It is, therefore, a relational prefix.
",29.41243934631348," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).
 (3a) kalaptt ka-mi-hxaak

‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child on-stops-to-rest

(3~) *bxaah kalapeeka-ma-yi-hxaak
Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.
(4a) salaap a-dting kalaptt ha

‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles fell on the child’.)
(4b) ?kalapCt salaap ha dting
(4~) kalapee salaap ha-dting
child measles dative-fall + unitary
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles on-fell the child’.)
(4d) *kalapeC ha salaap ha-dung
In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha
measles thematic + aspect-fall + multiplechildren dative
‘The children caught measles.’ (Lit., ‘Measles fell on the children’.)
’ The glosses ‘dative’ and ‘ablative’ are merely convenient terms for referring to the postpositions
hd and bti (with their correspondingprefixes ha- and ba-), respectively.",30.159887313842773,"The purpose of this paper is not so much to reconstruct an earlier syntax of

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.

possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).
 (3a) kalaptt ka-mi-hxaak
child thematic-thematic+ aspect-stop = to = rest

‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’

‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child on-stops-to-rest
the tree’.)
(3~) *bxaah kalapeeka-ma-yi-hxaak
Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.
(4a) salaap a-dting kalaptt ha

‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles fell on the child’.)
(4b) ?kalapCt salaap ha dting
(4~) kalapee salaap ha-dting
child measles dative-fall + unitary
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles on-fell the child’.)
(4d) *kalapeC ha salaap ha-dung
In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha
measles thematic + aspect-fall + multiplechildren dative
‘The children caught measles.’ (Lit., ‘Measles fell on the children’.)
’ The glosses ‘dative’ and ‘ablative’ are merely convenient terms for referring to the postpositions
hd and bti (with their correspondingprefixes ha- and ba-), respectively.",61.6971321105957,0,0.9275682602851184," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last
I1 Table 2 does not include all uses of prefixes of these surface forms. There are, for example,
thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).

 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this

the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with

8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).

and (1Oh)).

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",69.06884002685547," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two

most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",59.55433654785156,0,0.9508970399884572," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).

father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go

E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",61.65919494628906,0,0.9275682602851184," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).

(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",60.89908599853516,0,0.4655373192857284,"E. M. H. Weir / NadCb verb prefixes:diachronic development 313

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

",27.31518745422364,0,0.8272023633570359," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last

thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-

different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in

The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

Nadtib, but rather to present a hypothesis concerningthe origin of certain verb
prefixes based on internal synchronicevidence. Before considering this hypo-
thesis in detail, an understanding, in general terms, of some features of Nadeb
is necessary. Section 2 provides this backgroundinformation,dealing prin-
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development293
 cipally with the basic structure of sentences and phrases as encountered in the
 examples, the system of verb prefixes, and the grammatical rule which
currently allows incorporation of (most) postpositions into the verb phrase.

 This non-cooccurrenceof the prefix ba- with the negative na- is in contrastto
 their cooccurrencein (lOf), which confirms that here ba- functionsas a
 subordination prefix, while in (1Of) it functions as a relational prefix.
8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).
",64.30288696289062,"Certain thematic prefixes, however, clearly have a
different origin, for example, in onomapotoeias(as with the verb pa-Muah
‘break in pieces’) or in loan words (as with the verb mu-xikh ‘say mass’, which
is a loan word from Lingua Geral, an old Brazilian contact language still
spoken in some areas).
",65.72750091552734," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).
 (3a) kalaptt ka-mi-hxaak
child thematic-thematic+ aspect-stop = to = rest
bxaah y6
treeon=top=of
‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadCb verb prefixes: diachronic development 301
(3b) bxaah kalapeeyo ka-mi-hxdak
‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child on-stops-to-rest
the tree’.)
(3~) *bxaah kalapeeka-ma-yi-hxaak
Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.
(4a) salaap a-dting kalaptt ha
measles formative-fall + unitary childdative
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles fell on the child’.)
(4b) ?kalapCt salaap ha dting
(4~) kalapee salaap ha-dting
child measles dative-fall + unitary
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles on-fell the child’.)
(4d) *kalapeC ha salaap ha-dung
In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha
measles thematic + aspect-fall + multiplechildren dative
‘The children caught measles.’ (Lit., ‘Measles fell on the children’.)
’ The glosses ‘dative’ and ‘ablative’ are merely convenient terms for referring to the postpositions
hd and bti (with their correspondingprefixes ha- and ba-), respectively.",28.22954368591309," It is not possible,
however, to say which na- precedes the other, since they are identical in form and never separated
by any other prefix. This is the only case of the co-occurrenceof two prefixes of the same form,

presence of any derivational,thematic, or relationalprefix, or anyincor-
porated element.
2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.
",29.969661712646484," A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).
",68.9874496459961," Thus, the study of Nadeb verb prefixes providesan example of the
application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).
",67.36262512207031," The reconstructionof this diachronic process from synchronic evidence has
proved to be a very valuable analytical tool which has made possible a deeper
 316E. M. H. Weir / Nad2b verb prefixes:diachronic development
understanding of some areas of the language, especially the function of verb
prefixes and relative clauses. It has also provided a reasonable explanation for
the presence of some of the many verb prefixes in an OV language.
",74.6443862915039,"In the case of the postpositiong6 ‘inside’, there is at least a strong
preference for the use of a relative clause as modifying NP (example (Isa)).
Some speakers demonstrate uncertaintyas to the acceptability of a headless
relative clause in this context, while others reject this form (example (1 Sb)).

8.5. Summary
In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

",60.88644409179688,0,0.4655373192857284,"Several unusual features, some very peripheral to the present topic of study,
have been noted in passing. These include basic word order, prefix ordering
rule, restricted choice of relative clause head, and the whole area of incorpora-
tion into the verb phrase. These, and other areas of Nadeb, will be the subject
of further exposition in future papers, and could perhaps make valuable
contributions to linguistic theory in general. As data becomes available from
related languages, and as research into Nadeb continues, it should become
possible to apply the comparative method, and to establish some of the
characteristics of this as yet almost unknown linguistic family.

uncertainty about the use of ma- in the negative. Some speakers prefer the

which my father shoots’.8 In this headless relative clause, the prefix ma-
indicates that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is the means, and, in this
sense, it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. We shall return to
this point after considering the prefix ba- ‘ablative’ in the next section.
7. The postposition b&and the verb prefix ba- ‘ablative’g
Let us consider now the behaviour of the postposition bi ‘ablative’ in
relation to the prefix ba-. The process of incorporation into the VP and
prefixation of the postposition bti in (lOa) would result in the form (lob),
where t6b ‘house’ would be the direct object of the sentence. This form,
however, is unacceptable. On the other hand, the relative clause derived from
it by the relativization (and deletion) of the direct object, tbb, is acceptable
(1Oc).
(10a) ee a-gti tabb6
 father formative-be = in = hammock house ablative
 ‘My father is in the house.’
(lob) *tab eC ba-git
(1Oc) te ba-gli doo
 father ablative-be = in = hammock the = one
 ‘The one in which my father is.’
Examples (10d) and (10e) correspond to (Se) and (8f) in the previous case.
As in the case of the prefix ma-, (10e) represents the fronting of the PP
(probably to a position of focus), while (10d) is interpreted as a cleft sentence,
in which the complement is the PP t6b bti ‘in the house’, and the subject is the
headless relative clause 2 ba-gi ‘where my father is’. The prefix ba- indicates
that the relativized (and deleted) constituent is an adverbial, and, in this sense,
it is a mark of concordance and of subordination. The form (10e) is much less
frequent than either (10a) or (10d).
*An apparently acceptablealternative analysis could be put forwardfor examples such as (8e)
and (Sf). It couldbe arguedthat(8e) is simplya finite main clausewith fronting of the PP
constituent, rather than a cleft sentence, i.e. that the forms (8e) and (8f) are equivalentand that
(8f) is g&dually being replaced by (8e) since relational prefixes came into the language.",63.172943115234375,0,0.9376611142967772," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.

 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this

stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti

",61.54235458374024,0,0.9275682602851184," Lightfoot points out some of the deficienciesof,
among other things, one of the fairly generally accepted basic assumptions of
internal reconstruction, viz. that ‘morphologicalpatterns will partially recapi-
 tulate the syntax of an earlier stage of the language in a consistent way’ (1979:
 160). He shows that morphology is not only ‘very slow to adapt to syntactic
changes, but also it mirrors earlier syntax only in a selective way’, concluding
 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax
because, while each of the individual forms reconstructed may be accurate,
 there is no reason to suppose that they each reflect the same earlier stage,
whether they reflect the syntax of 500, 1000 or 2000 years ago’ (1979: 161).
This last point is also made by Chafe (1959: 481). In the light of its
limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely
as a prelude to the comparative method.
",60.652740478515625,0,0.4655373192857284," The next postpositionsto be subjected to this process will
 probably be those whose forms are most similar to those of prefixes, viz. pa
 ‘beside’ (examples (17ac)), and wti ‘beside’ (examples (18a-c)).",23.540138244628903,0,0.8568679972491892,"312E. M. H. Weir / Nadt?b verb prejxes: diachronic development
 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n

‘The child is supping honey.’

 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",63.1388053894043,0,0.9376611142967772,"Certain thematic prefixes, however, clearly have a
different origin, for example, in onomapotoeias(as with the verb pa-Muah
‘break in pieces’) or in loan words (as with the verb mu-xikh ‘say mass’, which
is a loan word from Lingua Geral, an old Brazilian contact language still
spoken in some areas).

or by the presence of the aspect prefix i-.
 (iv) The thematic prefixes, which occur obligatorilywith certain verb roots,
but not at all with others, and whose meaning is often difficult or
impossible to isolate from that of the root. A verb may have more than
one *thematic prefix. Some obligatory prefixes have a fairly clear
connectionwith derivationalprefixes, as in the case of the ka- in ka-
koon ‘crawl’, which is probably the derivationalreflexive prefix. How-
ever, when the verb root cannot occur without the prefix, as in this case
(cf. *a-koon), the latter is regarded as thematic rather than derivational.
 (v)The relational prefixes, which change the grammatical relations within
the sentence, such as ya- ‘on top of’, ga- ‘inside’.
 (vi) The subordination prefixes, which occur in certain embedded clauses,
and, in the case of relative and headless relative clauses, indicate the
grammatical function of the relativized (and deleted) constituent;for
example, ma- ‘relativized means’ (glossed RM in the examples), ba-
‘relativized adverbial’ (glossed RA).
This paper will be concernedprimarilywith relational,subordination and
derivationalprefixes. Thematic prefixes will be considered only briefly.

between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but

comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).

Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).
",67.29784393310547," That postpositions can be of nominal origin may also be seen from the
existence of a number of composite postpositions which clearly are formed
from nouns by addition of a simple postposition (or other morpheme). An
example of such a composite postposition is ith6 ‘under’, formed from the
noun id ‘the underneath’ and the dative postposition hd. There is a tendency to
shorten composite postpositions (and some other expressions when the last

thematic prefixes which include the forms ya-, ha-, ga-, ma- and ba-, a subordinationuse of ba-
which marksfinite complement clauses, etc., but these are outside the scope of this paper.

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’

‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.

 The prefix ba- is used in this construction, not with locatives only, but with

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).
",26.297691345214844,0,0.8272023633570359," Thus, the study of Nadeb verb prefixes providesan example of the
application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).

2.3. Incorporation of postpositions into the verb phrase
There is a rule in Nadebby which the head of the absolutiveNP or the head
(postposition) of most PPs may be incorporated into the VP. This paper is
concerned with such incorporation of postpositions,illustrated in the following
example with the postposition mahang ‘among’. Example (la), represented by
the tree in (lc), is an intransitive sentence which contains a PP, Nadttb mahang
‘among the Nadeb’. The form in (lb), represented by the tree in (Id), results
from the advance of the NP, Nadtlb, dominated by this PP to the position and
function of direct object in the sentence. This advance is brought about by the
incorporationof the postpositionmahang into the VP.

 The process of incorporation of postpositions into the VP always results in a
change in grammatical relations within the sentence, and, in the case of
intransitive verbs, in a change in the valency of the VP. Note that the new VP
in (1b), mahang wtit ‘among-lives’, is transitive, and that the NP Nadbtb occurs
in the normal direct object position, i.e. preceding the subject and verb.
",27.87431526184082," In sections 3 to 8, the behaviour of the following five postpositions in
 relation to incorporation is considered, each of which presents a slightly
 different pattern, as summarized below.
",29.048973083496094," Although the two forms (2b) and (2d) seem to be equally acceptable with
the verb a-sooh ‘be sitting’, this is not the case with the verb ka-mi-hxEak ‘stop
to rest’ of examples (3a-c). With this verb, which already has two (thematic)
prefixes, only the incorporated postpositionform (3b) is acceptable, and not
the prefixed form (3~). In (3~) the prefix ya- follows ma-, in accordance with
the ordering rule for verb prefixes. Native speakers consider the other two
possible orders, ka-ya-mi-hxduk and yu-ka-mi-hx&ak, even worse than the
order in (3~).
 (3a) kalaptt ka-mi-hxaak
child thematic-thematic+ aspect-stop = to = rest

‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadCb verb prefixes: diachronic development 301
(3b) bxaah kalapeeyo ka-mi-hxdak
‘The child stops to rest on the tree.’ (Lit., ‘The child on-stops-to-rest
the tree’.)
(3~) *bxaah kalapeeka-ma-yi-hxaak
Thus, it appears that, with the incorporationof the postpositiony6 into the
VP, a process of prefixationof the incorporatedpostposition has begun, but
that this prefixation has not yet developed with all verbs.
4. The postposition hii and the verb prefix ha- ‘dative”
Examples (4aad) and (5a-c) illustrate a slightly more advanced phase of the
prefixation process, with the postposition hZ ‘dative’. The incorporated post-
position form (4b) is unacceptable to some speakers, and is considered by
other speakers less acceptable than the prefixed form (4~). Once again, from
(4d), it is clear that the operation is not one of concordance.
(4a) salaap a-dting kalaptt ha
measles formative-fall + unitary childdative
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles fell on the child’.)
(4b) ?kalapCt salaap ha dting
(4~) kalapee salaap ha-dting
child measles dative-fall + unitary
‘The child caught measles.’(Lit., ‘Measles on-fell the child’.)
(4d) *kalapeC ha salaap ha-dung
In the case of a verb which already has another prefix, such as ki-ytik ‘fall
(multiple)’ in examples (5a-c), the situation is the same. Note that the prefix
ha- in (5~) follows the thematic prefix ka-, in accordance with the ordering rule
for verb prefixes.
(5a) salaap ki-ytikkalaptha
measles thematic + aspect-fall + multiplechildren dative
‘The children caught measles.’ (Lit., ‘Measles fell on the children’.)
’ The glosses ‘dative’ and ‘ablative’ are merely convenient terms for referring to the postpositions
hd and bti (with their correspondingprefixes ha- and ba-), respectively.",68.73434448242188," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",67.1615982055664," 308E. M. H. Weir 1 Nad2b verb prefixes: diachronic development
 8.2. In relation to relative clauses
 In all three cases, however,the relativization(and deletion)of the direct
 object (includingthe unacceptable form of (lob))results in an acceptable
 relative clause, the meaningof which correspondsto (6a), (8a), and (lOa),
 respectively(examples(6e), (8d), and (10~)).
(6e)t% ga-hing doo

‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
(8d)etmi-soom doo
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(10~) et- ba-gk doo
‘the one in which my father is’
In each case the function of the prefix is to advance the modifier NP in a PP to
direct object, i.e. to change the grammaticalrelations within the sentence, in
order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",74.22972106933594," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing

 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",59.3887939453125,0,0.9508970399884572," 310 E. M. H. Weir / Nadt?b verb prefixes: diachronic developmem
 This non-cooccurrenceof the prefix ba- with the negative na- is in contrastto
 their cooccurrencein (lOf), which confirms that here ba- functionsas a
 subordination prefix, while in (1Of) it functions as a relational prefix.
8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).

languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-
mental prepositionalexpressions in English ‘on top of’, ‘inside’, ‘instead of’,
‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).
",23.19179344177246,0,0.8568679972491892," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).

father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing

 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).

‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.

order to allow the relativization of the advanced constituent.",65.29108428955078,"E. M. H. Weir / NadCb verb prefixes:diachronic development 313

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",27.60891532897949," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).

father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’

In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

The fact that there are two very similar forms probablyaccounts for the
uncertainty about the use of ma- in the negative. Some speakers prefer the

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.

 1. Introduction
 The inspirationfor the title of this paper comes from two sources. The first
 is one of Bickerton’s basic assumptionsin his study on the formation of creole
 languages, viz. that ‘previous changes in any language inevitably leave their
 footprints behind them’ (1981: 105). The second source is Given’s paraphrase
of an early analect, ‘Today’s morphologyis yesterday’s syntax’ (1971: 413).
*Nadebis an indigenouslanguage spokenin the state of Amazonas in north-west Brazil. It has
been classifiedas belonging to the Maki or Maki-Puinave family (see, for example,Rivet and
Tastevin(1920), Mason (1950: 257-258),Tovar (1961: 1X&157), Loukotka(1968: 19&193))."," Thus, the study of Nadeb verb prefixes providesan example of the
application to the syntax and morphologyof a single languageof two of
Bickerton’s basic assumptions which he applies to the comparison between
different creoles to provide informationon the diachronic development of such
languages. These assumptions are: (i) ‘that previous changes in any language
inevitably leave their footprints behind them’, and (ii) ‘that diachronic changes
must be directly reflected in synchronic variation’ (1981: 105).
",64.2728271484375," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.

‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas

 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):

‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo

 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the

8.1. In relation to postpositionincorporation
By the process of incorporationinto the VP and prefixation of the postposi-
tion in (6a), the modifier NP in the PP is advanced to direct object in (6c),
which is synonymouswith (6a) (although with a few verbs this process
introduces a new aspect of meaning, viz. that of initial action; see example
(7a,b)). The process of incorporation and prefixation of the postpositionme,
however, almost always introducesthe aspect of initial action;i.e. (8c),
although an acceptable form, is not synonymous with (8a). On the other hand,
in the case of the postposition bti, the form which results from the process of
its incorporationand prefixation is unacceptablein main clauses (lob).

‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom

 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof

When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.

a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the

The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

 This non-cooccurrenceof the prefix ba- with the negative na- is in contrastto
 their cooccurrencein (lOf), which confirms that here ba- functionsas a
 subordination prefix, while in (1Of) it functions as a relational prefix.
8.4. In relation to use of a relative or headless relative clause as modljier in a
 postpositional phrase
We shall now examine the case of a relative or headless relative clause as
modifier in a PP. Only a relative clause, and not a headless relative clause, can
 occur as modifier of most postpositions,as illustrated with the postposition
mahang ‘among’ (examples (14a, b)).
(14a) hi-yxoonh doo mahang
thematic + aspect-be = valiantthe = one among
‘among the valiant ones’
(14b)* hi-yxoonh mahang
On the other hand, the reverse is true in the case of the postposition bti, i.e.
a headless relative clause is used, but never a relative clause (examples (log)
and (1Oh)).
(log) ecba-gti bti
father RA-be = in = hammockablative
‘where my father is’
(10h) *I% ba-gti doo bu
Once again the negative na- excludes ba-, which confirmsthat ba- here
functions as a subordination, rather than a relational,prefix (examples (1Oi)
and (1Oj)).

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).

 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.
",64.2241439819336,0,0.9521213706109554," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’

negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-

"," A link between post- or pre-positionsand nouns is not uncommon in
languages. Compare, for example, the obvious connection between the supple-

‘in front of’, etc., and the nouns ‘top, ’ ‘side’, ‘stead’, ‘front’, etc. Given shows
that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

 The inspirationfor the title of this paper comes from two sources. The first
 is one of Bickerton’s basic assumptionsin his study on the formation of creole
 languages, viz. that ‘previous changes in any language inevitably leave their
 footprints behind them’ (1981: 105). The second source is Given’s paraphrase
of an early analect, ‘Today’s morphologyis yesterday’s syntax’ (1971: 413).

8.5. Summary
In conclusion,it is clear that the three prefixes considered in this section are
multi-functional,in contrast to the prefixes ya- (used only with certain verbs)
and ha-, discussed in sections 3 and 4, respectively,which are always rela-
tional. In fact, the relational use of ba- occurs relatively infrequently, while its
use as a subordination prefix seems to be well established and consistent,i.e.
there is no uncertainty regarding the presence or absence of ba- in the
negative, and only headless relative clauses, never relative clauses, are per-
mitted as modifiers of the postpositionbti.

 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.

 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’

However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo

 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-

introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the

headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).

 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or

bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The

10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the

(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the

some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative

assumption that these reflect an older VO order (for which, in fact, there seems
to be little evidence; word order is mentioned in section 2.1, and discussed in
more detail in Weir (1980, 1984: 270-284)).3 It also predicts the possible
future appearance of further prefixes, and the extension of certain subclasses
of prefixes (relational, subordination, and derivational).
",59.169376373291016,4,0.5775747964727924," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go

‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No

a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

9. Origin of postpositions
The origin of those verb prefixes which have been derived from incorporated
postpositions can, in fact, be traced one stage further back. There are clear
indications that at least some postpositions have arisen from nouns (often
obligatorily possessed body parts), nominalized forms of verbs, or demonstra-
tive locative words. For example, with the postpositions y6 ‘on top of’ and g6
‘inside’ discussed above, compare the obligatorily possessed nouns yb ‘the
back’ and go ‘the inside’. The postposition pa ‘beside’ may have some
connection with the obligatorily possessed nouns tapa ‘side of face’ and kalapa
‘ribs’ (stress is on the last syllable in nouns). The postposition bai ‘ablative’
most probably is associated with the demonstrative locative word btibai ‘here’.
",64.5443115234375," In this case, the incorporatedpostposition form (6b) is unaccept-
able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration.",25.35431289672852,"For details, see Weir (1980, 1984: 270-284).

G%) et ma-ni-s&mdoo me
‘with that with which my father doesn’tshoot’
 (8k) et ni-s&m me

This is in accordance with the present analysis that ma- functionsas a
 relational prefix in (8h) and (8j) and as a subordination prefix in (8i) and (8k).
The fact that there are two very similar forms probablyaccounts for the
uncertainty about the use of ma- in the negative. Some speakers prefer the

",57.9693489074707,0,0.5859667802876273," Lightfoot points out some of the deficienciesof,
among other things, one of the fairly generally accepted basic assumptions of
internal reconstruction, viz. that ‘morphologicalpatterns will partially recapi-
 tulate the syntax of an earlier stage of the language in a consistent way’ (1979:
 160). He shows that morphology is not only ‘very slow to adapt to syntactic
changes, but also it mirrors earlier syntax only in a selective way’, concluding
 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax
because, while each of the individual forms reconstructed may be accurate,
 there is no reason to suppose that they each reflect the same earlier stage,
whether they reflect the syntax of 500, 1000 or 2000 years ago’ (1979: 161).
This last point is also made by Chafe (1959: 481). In the light of its
limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely
as a prelude to the comparative method.

8.3. In relation to cleft sentences
In the case of cleft sentences,however, there is an important difference
between the behaviourof the three prefixes (examples (8e), (IOd), (6d), and
(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the
prefixes ma- and ba- is not to effect a change in grammatical relations,but
E. M. H. Weir / Nadtb verb prefixes: diachronic development 309
rather to indicate that the relativized constituent in the headless relative
clauses is the means and the location, respectively. Thus, here the prefixes are
behaving as subordination, and not relational, prefixes.
(se) sxoow me tit mi-s&m
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
(10d) tab bB ee ba-gti
‘It’s in the house that my father is.’
On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).
(6d)* hxooh go Ce ga-hing
(6f)hxooh go et ba-hing
‘It’s in a canoe that my father goes downriver.’
Thus, ga- is not used to indicate relativization of a constituent in a headless
relative clause, i.e. ga- is not a subordination prefix, as in the cases of ma- and
ba- in examples (se) and (10d).

able to all speakers, while the prefixed form (6~) is acceptable to all. Once
again, the prefix ga- cannot be considered a mark of concordance(6d).
 (6a) Ce a-hinghxooh go
father formative-go = downriver canoeinside
‘My father goes downriver in a canoe.’
 (6b) *hxooh et go hing
 (6~) hxooh Ce ga-hing
 (6d) * hxooh go ee ga-hing
 However, with the incorporationof 86, another feature appears in the case
of certain verbs, viz. a change in meaning in the new VP. This is illustrated in
examples (7a, b), with the verb i-y6bm ‘plant’. The non-incorporatedform (7a)
is used to refer to any act of planting in the field, at any time, while the
prefixed form (7b) is used only to refer to the first planting (after cutting down
the patch of jungle and burning it). Thus, the two forms, (7a) and (7b), are not
synonymous,but rather the prefixed form has a more restricted meaning. It
appears that, at this stage, the meaning difference applies only to certain verbs.
In the case of a-hing ‘go downriver’ of examples (6ad), the non-incorporated
and prefixed forms are synonymous.
 (7a) kadi-y&m gtitiw go
uncle aspect-plant field inside
‘My uncle plants in the field.’
E. M. H. Weir / NadFb verb prefixes: diachronic development 303
 (7b) gtitiw kad gi-yoom
 field uncle inside + aspect-plant
 ‘My uncle plants the field (for the first time).’
It will be seen in the following section that such a meaning change applies in
the case of main clauses, but not in the case of relative clauses. The introduc-
tion, with some verbs, of a meaning change in main clauses indicates that, in
these cases, the prefix is functioning as a derivational prefix.
6. The postposition me and the verb prefix ma- ‘by means of’
 With the postposition me ‘by means of’ (generally instrument or path), a
new phase of the development of the prefixes is seen (examples (8a-f)). As in
the case of 86, the incorporated postposition form is unacceptable (8b).
 (8a) et i-soom sxoowme
 father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
 ‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 (8b) *sxoow et me i-s66m
 Now, however, the process of meaning change in the prefixed form appears
to have become more firmly established. Example (8~) is not synonymous with
(8a), but has the restricted sense of initial action corresponding to (7b). No
verbs are encountered in the available data which admit a form of the type
(8~) as synonymous with the corresponding form of type (8a) in main clauses,
when ma- is used in the sense of ‘instrument’.
 (8~) sxoowte mi-s&m
 blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
 ‘My father tries out the blowgun.’ (A stage in the manufactureof
 blowguns.)
When used in the sense of ‘path’, however, there is at least one verb, i-gxa’as
‘look’ (example (9)), which does admit the prefix ma- in main clauses without
the initial action aspect of meaning.
 (9) maliiyf%mi-gxaas
 machete father by = means = off aspect-look
 ‘My father sights along the length of the machete.’
 304E. M. H. Weir / NadPb verb prefixes:diachronic development
However, the meaningwhich corresponds to (8a) continues with the pre-
fixed form in relative clauses(8d). Compare with the corresponding relative
clause of example(6e):
(8d) eemi-s66m doo
father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun the = one
‘the one with which my father shoots’
(6e) etga-hingdoo
father inside-go = downriverthe = one
‘the one in which my father goes downriver’
 The prefixes considered up to this point, viz. ya- ‘on top of’, ha- ‘dative’, ga-
‘inside’, and mu- ‘by means of’, are classified as relational prefixes or, in the
case of meaning change, derivationalprefixes. In example (8e), however, a new
characteristicappears with the prefix ma- ‘by means of’, viz. the occurrence of
the postposition me in the PP SX&W me ‘with a blowgun’ in combinationwith
its corresponding prefix, ma-, attached to the verb. This is in contrast to the
behaviourof all the other postpositionsexamined up to this point. Compare
(8e) with the unacceptable forms (le), (If), (2c), (2e), (4d), and (6d).
(8e) sx66w me et mi-s&m
blowgun by = means = of father RM + aspect-shoot= with = blowgun
‘It’s with a blowgun that my father shoots.’
Now the operationappears more a type of concordance than simply incor-
poration."," E. M. H. Weir / Nadt’b verb prefixes: diachronic development311

(6f)). Examples (8e) and (10d) are cleft sentences whose subject is a headless
relative clause and whose complement is a PP. Here the functionof the

On the other hand, the prefix ga- functions in a different manner. When the
complement of a cleft sentence is a PP which contains the postposition 86, the
headless relative clause (subject) is marked with the prefix ba- (which, as has
already been stated, appears with any adverbial, except means and object of
comparison, in the position of complement), and not with ga- (examples (6d)
and (6f)).

different relationships between them are interpreted as illustrationsof stages in
a process of syntactic change which appears still to be continuing in the
language.2
The method of deducing the stages of a diachronic process from synchronic
variationhas also been used by Bickerton in his study of tense-modality-
aspect systems in creole languages. After specifying three distinct distributions
of the anterior marker over the range of creoles, Bickerton affirms: ‘If we were
working with a static-synchronicmodel, we would have to stop with this
statement. However, since we have to work with a dynamic model in order to
account for creole development, we can next propose that these three “states”
in fact constitute stages in a diachronicdevelopmentand exemplify a gradual
process (. . .) which is well advancedin some creoles and has not begun in
others. In order to prove that states in different languages show different
stages of the same process, it is desirable to be able to point to languages in
which two stages co-exist synchronically’ (1981: 80). In the creole case,
Bickerton applies the method to variation between different creole languages,
whereas the present study applies it to variationwithin one language. The
behaviourof some individualpostpositions and prefixes reveals sufficient
evidence of a state of transitionto indicate that a gradual process is indeed
involved.

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.

 On the other hand, both the corresponding uses of ma-, relational and
subordination, occur frequently. The uncertainty regarding the correct form of
the negative, and the alternative forms of the nominalized clause (relative or
headless relative) which occurs with the postposition me, indicate that pro-
bably the use of mu- as a subordination prefix is in a less developed phase. The
introduction of a meaning change (initial action) in most main clauses with the
prefix mu- indicates that, in these cases, the prefix is being used derivationally.
A derivational use of mu- (initial action aspect) has, in fact spread, probably
by analogy with forms such as (8~) to several other verbs, such as i-d6dn ‘sup
with the finger’, as in (16a, b). Note that (16a) could not have been derived in
the same way as (8~) from (8a) (described in section 6), since mabaah ‘honey’
would be the direct object of the verb i-d_%n, certainly not the instrument
(16b).
 (16a) mabaah kalaptt mi-doon
honeychild initial = action + aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is tasting (i.e. trying a little bit of) honey.’
 (16b) mabaah kalapee i-d66n
honeychild aspect-sup = with = finger
‘The child is supping honey.’
 (8~) sx66wetmi-s&m
blowgun father by = means = of + aspect-shoot = with = blowgun
‘My father tries out the blowgun.’
 (8a) t%i-soom sxoow me
father aspect-shoot = with = blowgun blowgun by = means = of
‘My father shoots with a blowgun.’
 The ga- prefix, however, is evidently almost completely confined to rela-
tional uses, but with a few verbs it is used derivationally. There is, however,
already evidence to suggest that possibly a subordination use of this prefix will
develop in the future. One feature, more firmly established with mu-, but
already beginning to occur with ga-, is the acceptance by some speakers,
although with some hesitation, of a headless relative clause as modifier of the
postposition gd-. Table 2 summarizes the uses of the prefixes considered in this
paper.

 1. Introduction
 The inspirationfor the title of this paper comes from two sources. The first
 is one of Bickerton’s basic assumptionsin his study on the formation of creole
 languages, viz. that ‘previous changes in any language inevitably leave their
 footprints behind them’ (1981: 105). The second source is Given’s paraphrase
of an early analect, ‘Today’s morphologyis yesterday’s syntax’ (1971: 413).
*Nadebis an indigenouslanguage spokenin the state of Amazonas in north-west Brazil. It has
been classifiedas belonging to the Maki or Maki-Puinave family (see, for example,Rivet and
Tastevin(1920), Mason (1950: 257-258),Tovar (1961: 1X&157), Loukotka(1968: 19&193)).",58.83644104003906," The next postpositionsto be subjected to this process will
 probably be those whose forms are most similar to those of prefixes, viz. pa
 ‘beside’ (examples (17ac)), and wti ‘beside’ (examples (18a-c)).",23.823789596557617," E. M. H. Weir / Nadt’b verb prefixes: diachronic development311

 Native speakers show some uncertaintyregarding the correct corresponding
 negative forms, but the most generally accepted seem to be:
G%) et ma-ni-s&mdoo me
‘with that with which my father doesn’tshoot’
 (8k) et ni-s&m me
‘with that with which my father doesn’tshoot’
This is in accordance with the present analysis that ma- functionsas a
 relational prefix in (8h) and (8j) and as a subordination prefix in (8i) and (8k).
The fact that there are two very similar forms probablyaccounts for the
uncertainty about the use of ma- in the negative. Some speakers prefer the
forms with doe, i.e. those in which a relative clause is used.

that the supplementalprepositionsin both English and Bantu and postposi-
tions in Amharic ‘arise from nouns which were the heads of a genitival
construction’(197 1 : 400).
10. Conclusion
 Thus, from the comparisonof the present behaviourof various verb
prefixes, we can arrive at a hypothesis about the diachronic developmentof
relational prefixes and of some subordination and derivational prefixes starting
with the incorporationof postpositionsinto the VP. The incorporated post-
position first becomes phonologicallyattached to the verb, losing its stress and
changing its form (when necessary) to conform to the general surface form of
prefixes, but without any change in meaning in the sentence. The resulting
prefix is relational,performing exactly the same function as the incorporated
postposition, viz. that of changingthe grammaticalrelationswithin the
sentence. At first, this prefixation occurs only with certain verbs (probably
those without other prefixes), as in the case of y6 and ya- (examples (2a-e)
and (3a-c)). The prefixation then spreads to all verbs, and the corresponding
incorporatedpostpositionforms begin to disappear, as in the case of hi? and
ha- (examples (4a-d) and (5a-c)). The incorporated postpositionform even-
tually disappears completely, and in some cases a meaning change begins to
appear in main clauses with the prefixed form, as in the cases of gd and ga-
(examples (6a-d) and (7a,b)) and me and mu- (examples @a-c)). Thus the
prefix may become derivational in nature (introducinga further dimensionof
meaning) in main clauses, while remaining relationalin relative clauses. In
some cases, an additionalfunction of the prefix may arise in headless relative
clauses, viz. that of indicating the grammatical function of the relativized (and
deleted) constituent, i.e. the prefix may take on the role of a subordination
prefix, as in the cases of me and mu- (example(se)) and bti and ba- (example
(1Od)).

changes, but also it mirrors earlier syntax only in a selective way’, concluding
 that it is therefore ‘a most unreliableway of reconstructingearlier syntax
because, while each of the individual forms reconstructed may be accurate,
 there is no reason to suppose that they each reflect the same earlier stage,
whether they reflect the syntax of 500, 1000 or 2000 years ago’ (1979: 161).
This last point is also made by Chafe (1959: 481). In the light of its
limitations,the method of internal reconstructionis generally applied merely
as a prelude to the comparative method.

Internalreconstruction is defined by Chafe as ‘a procedure for inferringpart
 of the history of a language from material available for a synchronic descrip-
 tion of the language, and from that alone’ (1959: 478). Among the situations
he mentions where this procedure is importantis the case of ‘a language with
no known relatives and no written history’. The investigatorof Nadeb today
finds himself in a situation very similar to this, in that there are no adequate
descriptions available of languages known to be related, or of previous stages
 of Nadeb itself. The little materialwhich does exist tends to be of a
preliminary or fragmentarynature, and is not concerned with the specific area
 under discussionhere. Any present efforts to understand the diachronic
development of Nadeb must therefore be based principally on the method of
internal reconstruction.
